The business moved 1971 to Uppsala where it was located until 2009 when the need for new and larger premises became too big. The solution was to build our own property in Enköping, strategically located next to the E18 highway between Stockholm and Oslo.\n\nMinicars focus was initially slotracing and we were already in the 60's proud importers of famous brands such as Parma and Associated Electrics. In the mid-70's their manufacturing slid more and more towards RC products, which also became an natural progression for us.\n\nMinicars are since the beginning of the 80's a pure wholesale distributor who over the years have added more and more brands under our feets. A few milestones are eg Traxxas which we started importing in 1989, Futaba who we became agents for in 1990 and in 2020 we also became a O.S.Engine distributor. Today we are one of Europe's largest distributors with many different brands, and more than 30.000 products in stock.\n\nMinicars currently has 19 employees and supplies goods to retailers in more than 25 countries, with the Nordic countries as the main market.",

    "description": "Kruegermann Pickles & Sauerkraut is a German food production company with family recipes passed down five generations since 1896.\n\nHow we started: \nIn 1896 Carl Kruegermann started producing pickles in the small German town of Luebbenau located 60 miles south-east of Berlin. Luebbenau is located in the picturesque Speewald (Spree-river forest) renowned for fertile soil, good weather and the abundance of quality cucumbers, cabbage, and red beets. Locals preserved these crops and and it soon became the culinary art of the region. \n\nKurt Kruegermann, grandson of Carl, decided to flee what was then communist East Germany in 1961, which was eventually taken away by the DDR government. Together with his then pregnant wife Helga and 3 year old son Greg they emigrated to Los Angeles with no money in their pockets or understanding of the English language. In 1965, with business license and samples in hand he went to work. Using his \"old world\" recipes and high quality produce from California he sold his products to European delicatessens, gourmet markets and restaurants.\n\nWhere we are today:\nFrom humble beginnings in our backyard garage, today we have grown to 25,000 sq ft of manufacturing and storage space & supply some of the finest food markets and restaurants across many states and counties.\n\nFollowing the retirement of Kurt and Helga, sons Greg and Carl took over the family business. They both continue to manage the production of our products. Greg's own children, Eric and Kristina have also been able to become involved with the business. Eric manages online sales through our website and other sellers such as Amazon and Etsy while Kristina has been able to maintain our online presence on Instagram and Facebook.",

Our product is very interesting for restaurant owners through saving the effort and money of manually producing the product, and guaranteeing a consistency in the quality and taste as we depend on an automated production line that helps in reducing the risk of error.\n\nWe launched this project in cooperation with OZTAS, one of the top 3 Doner kebab production companies in Germany.

Founded in 1997 by American entrepreneur Chris Tara-Browne the company originated as a small espresso bar. Over subsequent decades, the brand pursued an intentional, organic, and coherent pattern of growth. Today Traveler’s Coffee enjoys a strong reputation as a recognized national brand and an emerging international brand. \r\n\r\nTraveler’s Coffee established its brand leadership initially in Russia through a relentless focus on the specialty coffee market and would be considered a leader in the third wave coffee movement. That all-out focus yielded concrete results and the company soared to dominate coffee championships throughout Russia. Traveler’s Coffee is currently the reigning champion for the National Roasting Championship of the Russian Federation. Consistent wins over the years in both coffee roasting and barista championships have naturally led towards establishing brand loyalty and credibility. \r\n\r\nCoffeehouse stores owned and operated by Traveler’s Coffee attract customers seeking authentic coffee quality. Consumer confidence has widened to include an enthusiastic following for the entire spectrum of food and beverage offerings. High quality product, strong price value, and a great coffeehouse environment are distinguishing hallmarks for the brand. Competitive advantages for Traveler’s Coffee generate unique opportunities as it enters a new phase in its growth.",

And the Costa dream was born. From tiny beans, great big Mochas grow, and for 13 consecutive years, we were voted the UK’s favourite coffee shop. Since being bought by The Coca Cola Company in 2019 our global growth mission commenced. We now have over 3,800 stores across 32 countries and over 8,300 Costa Express self-service units. We’re on an exceptional adventure…\n\nWe believe in great coffee for everyone……and we mean everyone! At the heart of what we do are our values; we believe in Warmth, Passion, Courage and Trust. Maybe it’s because we love coffee, but we really value a feeling of warmth in our teams and in our communities and pride ourselves in empowering our people to feel supported to make their own decisions. And we love a can-do attitude, boldness and the courage to create positive change. Some companies spout this kind of froth but don’t back it up in their actions, but at Costa Coffee we’re genuine. We have a collaborative and inclusive workforce, who continually unlock new growth and innovation.\n\nWe are proud to be a total coffee company, enabled to deliver more cups of great coffee, to more people more often. Our Retail stores deliver Barista hand crafted coffee to perfection while our Costa Express innovation has revolutionised the coffee on the go market. And if that wasn't enough, our Ready to Drink range as well as At Home solutions, and our Proud to Serve partnerships, allow our adventure to become more diverse and move faster. ",

    "description": "On November 22, 1978, Danny O’Neill picked his first batch of coffee beans in the mountainous coffee-growing region around the Poás volcano while studying abroad in Costa Rica. Right then and there, he fell in love with the country, the people and the coffee — especially the coffee. Fifteen years later, when Danny founded The Roasterie in his basement in one of Kansas City's great neighborhoods, Brookside, it just made sense that he would partner directly with farmers and pay above-market values to get the best of the best coffee beans.\r\n\r\nToday, direct trade makes more sense than ever. The Roasterie still believes in partnering with farmers at origin, in mutually beneficial direct trade relationships — removing the middleman from the equation. By doing this, our farmers get much higher prices for their coffees than they would with other trade systems.\r\n\r\nOne of the most renowned specialty coffee roasters in the nation, The Roasterie stands apart from other specialty and direct trade coffee companies. Nobody else does it like we do. We are committed to finding the best green coffee beans from around the world, for a fair price. Those beans are then roasted using a convection air-roasting method instead of the more traditional drum-roasting method, to ensure superior consistency and a tastier, smoother cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nQuality, freshness, education. That's what The Roasterie story is about. Try any of our coffees and you'll be able to taste and smell the difference our commitment makes.\r\n\r\nPublic tours at The Roasterie Monday - Friday at 10:00 A.M. & 12:30 - Saturday at 8:30 A.M, 10 A.M., 11:30 A.M., 1 P.M. & 2:30 P.M. - Sunday at 10:30 A.M & 12:30 P.M.

All machines are UL and NSF standard approved.\r\n\r\nOffering wholesale beans, high-quality espresso equipment, and service and training support, Mr. Espresso made its mark as one of the first full-service coffee roasting retailers in the market and has since become a Bay Area institution, serving a sizable share of coffeehouses and restaurants in San Francisco Bay area and beyond.\r\n\r\nMr. Espresso continues to be family-owned and operated with two generations of Di Ruoccos working together in the Oakland showroom and roasting facility to ensure that what Carlo Di Ruocco began over 30 years ago continues striking that wonderful balance between time-honored traditional methods and the emerging trends of the marketplace.",

    "description": "At Hudson River Trading (HRT) we are mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians, physicists and engineers. We research and develop automated trading algorithms using advanced mathematical techniques. We have built one of the world's most sophisticated computing environments, and our researchers are at the forefront of innovation in the world of algorithmic trading.\n\nHRT’s founding partners graduated from Harvard and MIT with degrees in computer science and mathematics, and founded HRT in 2002. Armed with programming skills and sharp quantitative minds, the founders hypothesized that by applying a fresh take to trading stocks, one that truly leverages the power of technology, they could meaningfully impact a world still dominated by manual operators. Very quickly, their algorithms saw success in the markets and HRT grew from their origins in US equities to a global, multi-asset class trading firm.\n\nToday HRT employs over 800 brilliant minds from a variety of disciplines—from highly technical to deeply mathematical to the liberal arts. We are critical thinkers and eager automators, chasing new solutions to any problem we encounter.\n\nWe trade on nearly all of the world’s electronic markets, and are a leading voice for fair and open markets. Our internal code of ethics far exceeds the expectations of the regulatory environment in which we operate. We are conscientious market participants advocating for fair and transparent markets for everyone. This philosophy influences every aspect of our research.\n\nPlease be aware that HRT emails will always come from the @hudson-trading.com domain; a genuine offer document will not be signed by a recruiter; and HRT will never request your personal banking information or payment of any kind during the recruitment process. If you have received what you suspect is a fraudulent offer or suspicious communication with HRT, or if you have any questions, please reach out to security@hudson-trading.com.",

The herbs holds a number of qualities which a beneficial for the health.\n\nBuchu helps to aid or prevent infections to the urinary system like urethritis, cystitis and prostatitis. Buchu is  a natural anti-inflammatory and antiseptic and can assist with the prevention of cystitis (bladder infection), prostate and kidney problems and it helps with incontinence associated with prostate problems. Buchu leaves offer natural relief from menstrual problems such as cramps and bloating.\n\nIn 2016 Buchu Trading acquired Sceletia and became the European distributor for this South African herbal tea as well.\n\nSceletia is a rare combination which combines the pleasant taste and aroma and health benefits of Honeybush with the powerful natural remedy for stress and anxiety, Sceletium.\n\nHoneybush, so named in recognition of its honey-scented flowers and the subtle overtones of honey in the fragrance and flavour of the tea derived from it.\n\nSceletium is a succulent occurring naturally in the Karoo and Namaqualand,  used for centuries by the Khoi and San and is known for its calming and mood-elevating properties.\n\nIn 2017 Buchu Trading, realizing and knowing that life and environment are precious, focused on organic products. This was found in becoming agent and distributor for Skimmelberg Buchu and Rooibos. A beautiful company, farming at a close to bio-dynamical way. Next to Skimmelberg we started to represent Cape Kingdom Nutraceuticals. Instead of trading Buchu tea, we started representing Buchu and it's health benefits.\n\nOur organic adventure continues by becoming the agent for Soil organic essential oils in the Netherlands and Germany and distributeur for Italy. Again a company focused on environment, it's people and  health.",

We are committed to creating a world where livelihoods are supported and uplifted, which is why we go beyond fair in compensating our partner coffee producers and artists. Join us in the pursuit of excellence, one sip at a time.\n\nIt starts with TRACEABILITY.\n\n\nThe reason wine producers are synonymous with wealth, and coffee farmers with poverty, is due to transparency or lack thereof. Our goal as a company is to get more people to care about where the coffee they're drinking came from. We accomplish this by providing that information, which can be confusing to anyone not familiar with it, via cool artwork and approachable data.\n\nHere's the secret to finding good coffee: the more information you know about the coffee, the higher the quality. That's it. That's the whole formula. Think about how often you'll just drink some coffee and have ZERO idea about where in the world that came from. Oh it's a blend? A blend of what? The reason that information is not normally provided is simple. The less you know about the origin, the less they have to pay the people who produce it.\n\nWe call our coffee Beyond Fair because as a company we are committed to always pay above fair trade minimum prices to coffee producers. We don't think they pay high enough so we do. Speaking of paying human beings a liveable wage: we pay all Superlost Partner Artists above market rates because exposure doesn’t pay artists, money does. Each Partner Artist drinks the coffee they're representing, and then they illustrate whatever it inspires in them.\n\nSo now it's your turn. Have a cup of Superlost, and see what it inspires in you!\n\nDRINK CREATIVELY",

For over four generations, our families have grown, processed and roasted the best quality coffee in the Monteverde Region, striving for harmony with the surrounding cloud forest.\n\nCoffee culture was first brought to Monteverde in the early 1930s by families from Costa Rica’s central valley. As descendants of that group of pioneers, we have treasured their legacy for years so we can share it with you today. Today, we cover coffee production all the way from seed germination to ripe cherries, to processing as sun-dried beans, and roasting.\n\nOur main farm is located in Cañitas, close to the Monteverde Cloud Forest, where we also roast and monitor quality in our cupping laboratory. We continue diversifying production with an organic vegetable garden, goats, pigs, and hens, and by maintaining half the land on this farm under forest cover, allowing for a balance between production and nature protection.\n\nIn 2008 we opened our LIFE Monteverde educational program on sustainable production, bringing together our passion for coffee, our experience in agriculture and education, and our appreciation for the importance of educating future generations Each year, nearly a thousand students learn from the farm’s educational resources and take back home lessons for a sustainable living.\n\nWe invite you to join one of our daily tours for an in depth coffee experience, to join a Life Monteverde program or simply enjoy a cup of coffee at the Coffee Center, in the heart of Monteverde.",

Through developing mutually beneficial relationships with the farmers, cooperatives, and communities we buy from, we are building a stronger, more resilient supply chain. \n\nWe are grateful to work with some of the finest coffee producers in the world — coffee producers well off the beaten path, who need a strong link to the consuming marketplace. The most important thing we do is to provide that link.

We tie prices to cupping scores so that they are consistent and transparent with a focus on the base price being sustainable.\n\nPossibly our greatest value add is in understanding the intricacies in the middle of the supply chain, ensuring that the work farmers do arrives in your hands with its fullest potential intact, ready for you to do your best work as well. \n\nIn that spirit, we’ve opened headquarters in Lima, Peru and Oaxaca, Mexico as well as our original HQ in Berkeley, California, allowing us to offer year-round producer support and manage collection, milling, and shipping logistics day-to-day throughout the entire season. \n\nWith over a decade of experience trading coffee on both ends of the specialty spectrum, we’ve learned that every roasting company can need help with their menus at times.

    "description": "George Howell Coffee was created in early 2004 to forge a new kind of partnership with coffee growers – one which recognizes their fundamental role and identity in the production of high quality coffees. We believe that one should not blend truly fine coffees, just like one does not blend fine wines, because they are already complete statements. There has been very little incentive, in terms of remuneration and acknowledgment, for producers to create really great coffees.\n\nOur primary objective is to roast and directly serve coffee lovers with the finest coffees on earth. In that role we have pioneered technologies and relationships to coffee farmers to raise quality to new heights. We currently have three cafes in the greater Boston area (at 505 Washington Street, Downtown Crossing adjoining the Godfrey Hotel, at Boston Public Market, and  in Newtonville). We are carefully expanding to further locations. We also wholesale fine coffees in a variety of roasts for restaurants, bakeries and other fine food establishments. See www.GeorgeHowellCoffee.com for more information.\n\nAficionados! You have barely tasted the tip of the potential quality iceberg! Coffee growers remain locked in the commodity matrix because the coffee-roaster tradition has promoted blends as products superior to the sum of their parts – meaning the single origin coffees. So, most farmers produce what the market demands: acceptable, large coffee lots for blending. Growers of anonymous coffees-to-be-blended depend for economic sustenance on the goodwill and/or temporal strategies of the buyers’ market, from giant corporations to Fair Trade. Coffee producers, so far, are only beginning to have a market platform for high-craft self-expression.",

Coffee producing countries and farmers quality of life needs to be improved thru coffee consumption in our part of the world. Coffee roasters are improving their methods of processing and cupping coffee to maintain a high quality product and in return can command a standard of living that is far beyond just sustaining livelihood.\r\nCognoscenti Coffee is currently working with Four Barrel Coffee, a roasting works in San Francisco, exercising direct trade with farmers and roasting coffee of the highest quality that allow for single origins to be expressed, limiting the need for blends. Their coffee is well balanced with body, clarity, and flavors that speak of the coffee terroir.\r\nOne of the greatest challenges now for coffee is changing our understanding of coffee, where it can stand alone without milk and sugar, the origins, the people involved and the optimistic direction that the coffee industry is heading that benefits both the customer and producer. The inherent characteristics of coffee don’t have to be astringent and bitter but rather the opposite full of amazing complexities that share flavor profiles as rich as wine.",

    "description": "Specialty Coffee Direct Trade\n\nThe Andrade family history began in 1901, with their ancestors at Capim Branco Farm, in Carmo do Paranaíba, High Cerrado, state of Minas Gerais. With the aim to produce high quality coffees, the new generation of Andrade family established their farms in this region during the 70’s. This region has an altitude between 1.100 and 1.200 meters, which provides ideal conditions for growing coffee due to its perfect balance of wet and dry seasons.\n\nIn the early 90´s, with the need for expansion of coffee production, quality and volume improvement, the brothers acquired São Silvestre farm in Serra do Salitre, state of Minas Gerais, this farm produces high quality coffees because of its climate and altitude between 1.100 and 1.200 meters.\n\nCombined with the natural conditions of the region, the correct management of crops, crop planning and post-harvest with selection criteria of cherries, grains and natural drying, the results are excellent quality, award-winning beans, appreciated worldwide.\n\nThe volcanic soils are perfect for growing Yellow Icatu, Yellow Catuaí and Red Catuai varietals, which thrives here and accounts for the majority of the farm’s yield. This is where Brazil’s best natural coffee beans are produced.\n\nIn 1991 through the initiative of twelve producers, who envisioned the opportunities that investing in the quality of the coffee would bring, they founded the BSCA ( Brazil Specialty Coffee Association) that supports all small coffee producers in the region, not only that, it also helps producers improve quality, which improves sustainability. Helping producers to reach out for the importers worldwide, with eco-friendly coffee is another activity that BSCA performs. We are proud to say that we are founders of the BSCA.\n\nWe founded an exporting company, which means that we have a direct relationship with our customers, sending our coffee from origin on a Direct Trade basis.",

    "description": "Our Vision is to become a leader at the intersection of coffee and health. \n\nOur Mission is to create the world’s healthiest coffee. We’ll accomplish our mission through a commitment to research, transparency and the scientific process. Also through continuous improvement in the way our coffee is sourced, roasted, delivered, and measured. The result is that as many people as possible learn about coffee’s disease preventing powers, and choose to drink Purity because of the superior health profile. Our Unique Value Proposition: Today, Purity Coffee is the only coffee company in the world that makes every decision – from seed to cup – to minimize negative compounds and maximize the beneficial attributes of the coffee bean. \n\nOur Belief System: We believe that your choice in coffee is one of the easiest adjustments you can make for your overall health and longevity.\n\nWe believe coffee is good for you - 19,000 scientific studies have been conducted on coffee and health. Taken as a whole, these studies overwhelmingly show that coffee is much more than just a delivery system for caffeine… It is a natural superfood, with astounding health benefits – and it has many compounds such as chlorogenic acid (CGA), lignans, quinides, trigonelline and magnesium to help reduce insulin resistance and systemic inflammation.\n\nWe believe that the health benefits of coffee can be enhanced – through conscious sourcing, roasting and processing. \n\nWe believe that drinking more healthy coffee is one of the easiest, highest leverage changes the average person can make to significantly enhance their health and wellness.\n\nWe believe that not all coffee is created equal. Purity’s unique protocol was developed under the direction and guidance of a world-class team of scientists, professors and researchers, lead by one of the top coffee scientists in the world, Dr. Adriana Farah. We’ve increased the health benefits of our coffee by eliminating or minimizing acrylamide, PAH, pesticides, and mycotoxins – and by roasting to maximize healthy CGA’s. After years of painstaking research and innovation, our lab results bare out the fact that Purity is the purest coffee available today.\n\nWhen it comes to the health benefits of coffee, there is a major gap between what science knows and what consumers think. Educating consumers regarding the health benefits of coffee is more than just important – it can save people’s lives. If people knew what we know about the health benefits of coffee, fewer people would suffer and die from the diseases upon which coffee has a profound positive effect; such as fatty liver disease, liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, type II diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. \n\nWe believe that if consumers knew what we know about coffee, they would use HEALTH as a criteria to purchase, in addition to cost, taste and convenience. This would transform the coffee industry and make the world a better, healthier place. When health becomes a criteria for purchasing coffee, coffee companies will be motivated to improve their processes in the farms and at the roasters, because they will have economic incentives to do so. That in turn will compensate the farmers to pay more attention to the quality of their crop and will lead to a living wage for more farmers because there will be a larger price gap between high quality coffee and commodity coffee. \n\nWe believe that using health as our single criteria for the coffee we produce means that we will continue to innovate to a better and better product for our customers. \n\nWe believe that we have just taken the first steps on a much longer journey. Coffee is an incredibly complicated product made up of thousands of compounds that are both created and destroyed in roasting.\n \nWe believe that we have just taken the first steps on a much longer journey. That we need to continue to innovate and enroll world class doctors and scientists to join the conversation.\n\n",

We are seeing an increasing number of roasters opening for business every year. To stay ahead JAVA must also go the extra mile, it is not about roasting the most coffee but roasting the best coffee and to make sure farmers are paid well to keep them in business. Without amazing green beans to roast, JAVA is a dodo. For that reason a key objective of JAVA is paying farmers well. We do not call it Fairtrade, we call it Fairly Traded.\n\nThe Fairtrade base price of $3.09 per KG of Arabica coffee has not changed since 2011. It is the same price internationally regardless of the big differences in economic and currency dynamics of each region.\n\nIn 2019 The Colombia Coffee Federation called for an international base price of $4.12 per KG so producers have a guaranteed income that would prevent farmers from abandoning the sector.\n\nFact: JAVA pays more to farmers for good coffee. JAVA's our current coffees start at 70% premium to the Fairtrade Arabica base price. \n\nThe graphic below demonstrates the average % premium JAVA pays for good coffee from origins we source from ABOVE the Fairtrade minimum base price of $3.09 per KG for Arabica washed coffee worldwide.

We promise every loose leaf tea and blend on our menu has been curated with honesty and integrity. All of our teas are allergen-free. Most are organic and certified Kosher, too. (Just look for those designations on their individual pages.) When you pour water over our tea leaves, you’ll immediately sense their natural, lively personalities. You’ll taste quality, freshness, and flavor. We started our family-owned loose leaf tea brand to share the affordable luxury of a fine cup of tea. Welcome to our family.\n\nOur Vision: Minimizing our footprint. Maximizing your bliss.\nEco-friendly packaging has come a long way since we started our loose leaf tea company! We respect the natural world as much as we respect the nature of teas. So we’re continually moving towards more sustainable packaging and shipping practices.

    "description": "Silk Road Teas is known as a purveyor of rare and artisan teas and tisanes. Each spring, we travel in the tea-rich southeastern provinces of China to source many of our teas. Visiting tea markets, small farms, specialty tea companies and tea brokers, we find the finest varieties of white, green, oolong, black and Pu-erh tea. \n\nThe teas we offer are grown and processed by true artisans of the leaf. We purchase most of our teas in small lots that are single origin and often handmade. It is our belief the best tea is harvested early in the spring, when the days are warming and the nights cool. In that brief harvest window, known as \"before the rain\" teas, the fresh and tender leaves offer nuanced flavors and tastes. These teas are limited in supply and are recognized as some of the finest teas in the world. Once plucked and processed, many of our teas are not blended and we preserve these unique small lots for our customers' enjoyment.\n\nIt is also worth noting that teas grown on small and specialty tea farms tend to use traditional methods of farming. As these teas are harvested in the spring before insect predation begins, the use of chemicals and pesticides is far less prevalent than on teas harvested later in the season and on larger farms. We make every effort to find farms practicing natural and organic methods. As China's consumer market continues to strengthen and demand for organic products grows, we increasingly source third-party certified organic teas to complement our line of traditionally grown teas. To encourage and complement organic farming, our business is a certified USDA NOP Organic Handler.\n\nWe sell to well-known U.S. tea companies, tea shops, specialty grocery, coffee companies and fine restaurants - purveyors of high-end, specialty teas throughout the United States and Canada, and directly to online customers.

NO MESS, NO DRIPS, NO SPOON \n\nAs an entrepreneurial F&B FMCG business founded in 2007, we developed our first brands we manufacture of infusion sticks ourselves several years later to initially solve a messy problem and allow retailers, businesses and consumers to save time and costs within high footfall HORECA environments. Creating a better experience especially within offices, events and conference centres, travel sector; airliners, cruise liners and trains. Our message is simple: ‘make life easier and better’.\n\nWhat are infusion sticks? A ready-to-brew recycled foil vessel filled with finely selected ingredients like herbals & leaf tea from around the world. \n\nInfusion sticks solve a genuine problem and our tagline sums it up simply: \n• No mess \n• No drips \n• No spoon \nOur clients love this concept as over time they see the savings not only on time and money, but the benefit to the environment as we move away from plastics and foil to biodegradeable materials that are environmentally sound and sustainable. The range of coffee pods and stick infusions results in fewer cleaning cycles, therefore less water used and reduced wastage of apparent disappearance of tea spoons!\nMaking a cup of tea and coffee has never been so easy. Now for 2020 with our NEW commercial and home compostable Nespresso compatible pods this will be the future. We source and roast our own coffee and also produce formats for Dolce Gusto compatible own brand and private label for large retailers and brands. \nOur main markets are Europe, China (Asia) and USA.

    "description": "O conceito do California Coffee® nasceu quando visitamos o Brasil. Uma questão nos surpreendeu. Porque o maior exportador de café do mundo, que produz um café tão fino e de alta qualidade, não tem a oportunidade de saborear o melhor do que produz? A resposta é muito simples: A maioria da produção dos melhores e mais finos cafés é vendida para a exportação. Os fundadores do California Coffee® decidiram, então, trazer a idéia de \"Specialty Coffee House\" para o Brasil. \r\n\r\nCalifornia Coffee® oferece apenas a melhor classe de café arábica, cultivado em regiões especialmente selecionadas. Lá o café é plantado em grandes altitudes, o que leva a um crescimento mais lento e a um sabor mais fino. O nosso café é selecionado a partir dos melhores grãos de exportação.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Coffee® se destaca por ser intransigente quanto a qualidade, o frescor e o serviço personalizado e reconhecido. Nossa meta é garantir o melhor copo de café possível, sem levar em consideração o custo ou o esforço exigido. Torrado o nosso café artesanalmente de acordo com os mais rígidos padrões europeus em nossa própria torrefação. Trabalhando continuamente para melhorar a qualidade e a consistência do café para trazer o melhor de cada grão para você.\r\n\r\nFinalmente, o maior produtor mundial já pode beber o mesmo café servido nos mais finos Coffee Shops do mundo.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Coffee®, no Brasil desde 2002.",

Actually the English word 'coffee'​ comes from the Arabic word for coffee, pronounced 'qahwe'​. Our passion for coffee was the motivation for the establishment of Caffe Aroma. The concept for Caffe Aroma was born out of the necessity for an Italian style coffee house in a city dominated by Lebanese style cafes. Thus Caffe Aroma was established in the year 1996 with a simple mission; to provide good coffee within a beautiful setting, and unrivalled service for customer satisfaction which is second-to-none.\r\n\r\nHere at Caffe Aroma, we serve only the best quality food and coffee because we believe that our clientele deserve nothing less. The ambience, along with our delectable food provide a nearly utopian experience. Initially we specialized in quality coffee, sandwiches and roasted coffee beans, but in the year 1999, we expanded our operations to include a world-class restaurant to meet our loyal customers'​ demands. By offering a mouthwatering array of dishes, we evolved from a humble cafe into a five-star restaurant which caters to all. Our service and decor provide a unique environment for all our customers whether dining or enjoying a cup of coffee while puffing on one of our many flavored shishas. Caffe Aroma is a perfect stop for friends to gather and enjoy themselves, as well as a great place for families to enjoy quality time together while enjoying great food. Caffe Aroma reflects the cosmopolitan nature of the city of Jeddah in that we provide culturally diverse cuisine, bringing to you the most beloved dishes from around the globe.",

    "description": "Our journey began in 2008 when we proudly opened Barcey’s Cafe in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and became an instant hit. We were one of the neighborhood’s trailblazing coffee shops, quickly evolving into an all-day – everyday brunch hotspot that everyone loved. \n\nWith success came a lot of challenges and the dreadful and grueling long hours of work, but we endured it for the rewarding experience of sharing the comfort and tranquility perfectly brewed coffee brings. We loved what we did.\n\n\n\nEverything changed in 2017 when we were expecting our first child. After a long and successful stint of operating our business, we decided to let it go to focus more on our baby and her special needs. By the end of 2018, we had sold our business, and though it was the toughest decision we have ever made, we have no ounce of regret to date – it was an amazing run. \n\nAs seasoned entrepreneurs, we could not help but wonder what our next venture would be after this entire ordeal; however we were certain that our love for coffee will never part from us. This led to the idea of creating a convergence of artisan coffee roasters to enable cafés, offices, small businesses across the nation to offer and rotate specialty coffees for their customers and employees regularly at wholesale coffee price. Roasters also get the opportunity to showcase their creations, reach more potential customers and with that premise, cafés and businesses can look forward to excited clients and employees, ready to down their next cup of joy.\n\nAbove all, everyone who is part of the process gets to enjoy the abundance and fulfillment of our overall team effort as we provide a platform where we can all share our constant love for coffee. It was on that notion that Barcey’s was conceived and we have not looked back ever since.\n\nTo share our love for coffee with the nation and the world at large by connecting businesses to artisan coffee roasters.",

His entrepreneurial pursuits led him to launch a NY-based concept internationally in his home country of Brazil of Sao Paulo for three years, before returning stateside and joining the management team of one of Miami’s premier fine dining restaurants.\n\nWith a degree and background in tourism, Francini’s unique international experience includes endeavors in the gastronomy space, including one of the largest cafés in Dublin, Ireland in 2006. Following her arrival in the states, she continued building her experience in hospitality and various cuisines, most notably including French with renowned Chef Alain Ducasse.\n\nAfter relocating their young family from Miami to Orlando in 2019, both Pedro and Francini recognized the opportunity to launch a business in the area. The idea first came about as not just another café or wine bar, but a cozy getaway that offered a place for people to relax, work and connect with one another. An inviting, family-focused atmosphere where you can grab a coffee on the way to work, and – if you dare – a glass of champagne with a delicious sweet in the late afternoon, or a glass of Pinot Noir at the end of a long, productive day to unwind.\n\nLoop offers a complete experience, with service that starts from a place of love and unparalleled quality when it comes to sating your craving and filling your cup.\n",

We are a casual, relaxed place, which forms part of your daily or weekly routine. We are aiming to create a warm, comforting space that serves the type of food that you want to have with your friends, family and people close to you.\r\n\r\nHaving studied, worked and travelled across the world, we were inspired by the chilled-out back streets of New York, while working in various cafés in the city. The atmosphere of Manhattan’s long avenues, where people “can walk, chat, and enjoy their time, feeling stress-free”, helped to inspire the new café’s concept and name a world away in Dubai.",

Well into the aughts, he greeted customers, prepared drinks, wiped down tables, mopped floors, took out the garbage, and did his fair share of bookkeeping (among many other jobs!). He loved the sense of community he was building, but by the mid-2000’s he started to look for a way to grow this sense of community without his personal involvement in each espresso drink. He envisioned a company that would create goodwill with his customers by being the most responsible business it could be, a business that would bring back regulars time and again even if he wasn’t their barista. Think Coffee would become the realization of that vision. \n\nIn 2006, Jason opened the first Think Coffee location on Mercer Street in Greenwich Village with the mission of minimizing environmental impact and sourcing coffee as responsibly as possible. It wasn’t long after the Mercer Street opening that the Think Coffee team started to fulfill its mission by partnering with coffee producers around the globe. \n\nToday, Think Coffee remains steadfastly independent and locally owned, while working tirelessly to reduce its environmental impact and redress the inequities in the coffee supply chain. It has kept many of the same farmer relationships from its early days, providing long-term stable contracts over the years and returning hundreds of thousands of dollars to the farm working communities that need them the most. \n\n",

Amongst other things, minimizing fat content and using only natural ingredients became top values. More importantly, freshness was our top-priority, which ultimately meant making ice cream locally every single day.\n \nIn 2003, our first Copenhagen, Denmark cafe was opened on Sankt Hans Torv in Nørrebro. It proved so successful that within a year we opened another cafe, this time in Frederiksberg, Denmark. With three successful cafes thriving in such a short period of time, it became clear that Denmark loved Paradis.

Sparkling teas are just the latest creation from our decades-long pursuit of the finest teas around the world. It’s a natural evolution from our hand-blended tea business that continues to grow organically to an ever-expanding community of tea lovers worldwide. It all begins with our hand-blended tea recipes. The flavor we pack into each tea bag, each sip of sparkling tea, or our own micronized tea powder is vibrant and unique. We make every batch by hand in small lots – not because it’s easier – but because it’s the right way to create the product we want. Our blending facility and store are located in Whately, MA –  a small New England farming community.\n\nHow did sparkling tea come about?\n\nThe Tea Guys create, taste and refine new blends all the time. When a particular recipe called attention to itself, we’d make a batch, cold-filter it and add effervescence. It took time, but it was worth it, and soon it became the refreshment of the blending room.\n\nThese flavors are our favorites. And we’ll continue to bring you new ones. Sparkling tea is always a treat for us–hopefully it will be for you as well. \n\nFreshness isn’t something you crave occasionally: for those of us who really care about what we consume, freshness is mandatory.",

    "description": "We traveled the world during our college semester abroad and stumbled upon loose tea for the first time. It was in a tiny Czech teahouse in the center of Prague that got us hooked on tea.\n\nWe returned to the US and quickly discovered a problem. If we wanted loose tea, we had to go out of our way to a specialty store, pay an absurd price and confront confusing tea names and origins. The tea world was filled with too much jargon and stereotypes of stuffy tea parties. What if we flipped it upside down?\n\nWe started Tiesta Tea to revolutionize the way people consume tea.\n\nFinding the right tea should be simple: what will it do for me and what does it taste like. By focusing on function and flavor, we make tea approachable and easy to understand. We created five functional categories based on the health benefits that each blend naturally gives you. \n\nWe also believe that life is about more than just tea and business.\n\nWe believe in using our platform to give back directly to people in need in our communities. Billions of people lack access to clean water. To combat that, we set aside a portion of sales from each of our bottled teas to build water wells. We build these wells in communities in Nigeria that grow some of our ingredients. Because we want to support the communities that support us. Millions more do not have a place to sleep at night. Every January, our team and volunteers gather together to pass out hot tea and Warmth Kits to those living on the cold city streets of Chicago. We believe businesses shouldn’t just generate profits, they should do good, too.\n\nIt’s really that simple. Do what you love, step out of your comfort zone and be you. Be the best version of yourself that you can be and help others to do the same.\n\nLive Loose,\nThe Tiesta Tea Team\n\nRECENT AWARDS\n\n+ INC. BEST WORKPLACES 2018\n+ INC.

A serendipitous find for the earnest wanderer, the business is devoted to the luxury of fine tea and exploration of the senses with an unwavering adherence to excellence.\n\nThe founders of the award-winning company met while working at a well-known lifestyle brand,  Heidi Johannsen Stewart on the publishing side as a food editor and photo stylist and Michael Shannon as a product designer. “Before Bellocq we were often traveling around the world, discovering incredible tea and sharing it with each other,\" Michael explains. This delightful habit became ritual and, along with a passionate appreciation of traditional artisan work, ignited the idea for a business.\nBellocq’s carefully selected, single-origin offerings originate from the finest estates around the world and are exclusively full leaf, often organic, and sourced from high elevation gardens. “Our selections are the result of rigorous sourcing, cultivated relationships and lengthy tastings,” says co-founder Heidi. “The unifying factor is exceptional quality and a beautiful flavor profile.”  \n\nAsserting the notion that the finest teas can be an everyday luxury, Bellocq’s unique methodology is redefining the luxury tea business to suit the evolving and sophisticated spirit of the modern client.

John was introduced to the world of tea by Stanley Mason, who turned to creating his own craft tea blends after years in the corporate world of tea. Over time, Mason taught John both the art and business of the craft.\r\n\r\nStarting production out of his basement in 1983, John began his own journey in mastering the craft of tea blending. Serving his distinctive blends with inn guests, he soon found they were coming back for more. Never did John Harney imagine that his small home-run business in Salisbury, Connecticut would turn into a global operation, now headquartered in Millerton, New York filling 90,000 square feet of warehouse space, and employing over 155 people, making it one of the largest employers in the Hudson Valley. The company, which sources, blends, and packages their own product from start to finish, has grown from their original six teas, to more than three hundred. Their story truly captures the essence of American Business Ingenuity.\r\n\r\nHarney & Sons was founded on a commitment to deliver customers the finest quality tea possible. This promise, made 30 years ago, serves as the company's guiding principle. Today, Harney & Sons Tea remains family owned and managed, with three generations of Harney's preserving John's tradition of fine tea and traveling the world in search of the finest ingredients.",

With stores in NJ and NY, Booskerdoo is currently expanding along the East Coast. \n\nBooskerdoo is the only coffee/bakery franchise that roasts its coffee in front of the customer, creating a retail experience that stimulates all five senses. All coffee sold is roasted within the week, helping to create the most delicious coffee on planet earth (a bold statement, we know). \n\nYou can expect three things when you walk into one of our cafes: 1) Extraordinary coffee roasted on the retail floor and brewed with reverse osmosis filtered water on the industry's best drip and espresso equipment. 2) An exceptional food menu including a spread of pastries baked in-house each morning. 3) An inclusive culture founded on the simple idea of making people happy.\n\nSimply put, coffee roasted in the last few days tastes way better than the months-old beans everyone else sells. Add the experience of seeing and smelling your coffee get roasted, and that makes it taste even more delicious. Literally... it’s called sensation transference. Our in-house bakery has the same effect. The aroma sets the tone, the fresh products blow minds, and strong inventory control creates a beautiful business dynamic. \n\nIt’s a wonderful time to be in the specialty coffee business. Our consumer base is bigger than ever and still growing. With so much bad coffee out there, now is the time to secure a foothold as the premier retail coffee experience in your area. Reach out if you're interested in discussing a Booskerdoo franchise in your community. \n\nCheers,\nTeam Boosk\n",

And serve it in surroundings that will inspire.\n \nFirst, a clarification. We not only offer, but believe in extraordinary coffee – smooth, full-bodied, aromatically divine. Never sour or bitter. Even a little sweet, depending on the bean.\n \nEach sip is a revelation to the uninitiated, a warm embrace to the connoisseur. With the power to create conversation, launch a masterpiece, spark romance, change the arc of history. \n \nWe begin by working with our network of artisanal growers and importers, securing the most unique and interesting coffee beans in the world, at times so rare we’re the only ones in the entire country to have them.\n \nIn the few short years we’ve been around, our rare and exclusive coffees have developed quite a following, including our growing community of loyal subscribers. These discerning coffee lovers have our limited coffee roasts (and subsequently our artful coffee experience), shipped directly to their doorstep, as far away as, and this even surprised us, Dubai.\n \nAs we said, it’s extraordinary coffee.\n \nGoing a step further, we do our own roasting right here in LA, which may sound obsessive, but to us, it’s another critical step to ensure that we can control the quality, and taste, of our coffee.\n \nThe culmination of all of these efforts, the brewing of our coffee, is overseen by our dedicated and passionate staff, with a meticulous eye for detail. Nothing is overlooked. No shortcuts are taken.\n\nTo state the obvious, coffee this extraordinary can’t be served someplace, well, ordinary.\n \nEach goodboybob reflects our love of art, design, craft, and visual expression. Walk in and you’ll immediately feel the creative-inspired details.\n\nWe’re goodboybob. We invite you to stop by one of our locations. Or order a bag of our extraordinary coffee online. And join us on our journey. \n\n \n\n \n",

    "description": "Our Passion and Vision\r\n\r\nTerra Coffee and Tea represents the culmination of years of hard work and commitment by Carlo Granito, a humanist and entrepreneur who’s passionate about coffee. As a philanthropist who puts quality first, Carlo has worked with his team to develop a remarkable approach that enables them to bring the world’s best coffees to the Canadian and international markets.\r\n\r\nMotivated by a concern for the inequalities faced by coffee farmers, he follows a golden rule when purchasing green coffee beans. After an extremely meticulous search and selection process that can take up to 10 years, he generally offers above-market prices (up to 80% higher) so that farmers, their families and their communities have the means to improve their living conditions. \r\n\r\nThis unique approach to helping others has allowed Carlo to establish close relationships with these mountain-dwelling families who, in return, are pleased to offer him their best products. The farmers understand that it’s not in their best interest to sell their high quality coffee beans to large brokers who offer much lower prices. \r\n\r\nDespite the growth of his business, Carlo has chosen to preserve the traditional art of coffee roasting in order to guarantee freshness. He prefers to rely on the skills of Terra’s roastmasters   rather than use automated production equipment .\r\n\r\nHe will continue to promote the values of quality, generosity and respect exemplified by his role as a model corporate citizen.",

It’s why we’re crafting some of the very best, most delicious specialty coffees under the sun.\n\nIn beautiful Charlotte Amalie and South Florida, hospitality is second nature. We greet strangers with a smile, and new friends with a great cup of coffee. \n\nWhat makes our coffee so unusually enticing? The secret lies in our method of artisanal small batch roasting. Roasting our beans in smaller quantities leads to better quality control, and lets us capture flavors and aromas rarely found in mass produced coffees. It’s a difference you’re sure to notice—and so will your guests and customers.\n\nOf course, our expertise goes well beyond the roastery. We specialize in serving the hospitality industry and know exactly what it takes to run an exceptional hot beverage program. Our partner hotels and restaurants turn to us for everything from custom menu development to equipment management to staff training and more.\n\nYou’ll find our small batch specialty coffees delighting guests and customers in some of the region’s most beloved and highly regarded establishments. We’d love to craft one for you. After all, what says “welcome” better than a truly great cup of coffee?",

We aspire to build a platform to fully streamline communication between producers and consumers in the coffee industry - and thus to facilitate more transparent and equitable coffee transactions. Available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin (Simplified), Japanese, Korean and Bahasa.\n\nTastify allows a user to document the taste experience of a coffee in real time, in a visual-friendly way for easy reference in the future. The user then effectively notates a wide variety of different descriptors as they move through the cupping experience, and can add new descriptors along the way. As the user cups through different coffees, Tastify records each coffee in its database, and these data points can be brought up and referred to in a number of different manners. Tastify also comes with a guest user function where you can invite friends, clients or team members to join your cupping session for free.\n\nTastify also helps users to look for a particular flavor profile and can search their database by creating a custom set of flavor characteristics, and coffees that fit the profile they create will populate the screen. Furthermore, with a sufficient set of data points, our users could use this data as a powerful tool to communicate trends or comparison in quality and productivity to their partners at all chains in the industry, from farmers to roaster clients.\n\nFinally, Tastify can help you generate visually engaging reports and coffee score graphs or spider-webs. It can be used for client marketing collaterals, product presentation or simply to communicate between team members.",

Our cafe grew into a wholesale business in early 2013 and has grown to a local and national wholesale presence within coffee sales as well as equipment sales and maintenance. We currently have just under 15 employees between the two sides of the business.\n\nAs for our coffee itself, everything we buy is considered Specialty Grade by the Specialty Coffee Association standards and is sourced in a traceable manner from reputable importers and direct from farm whenever possible. Everything we roast is on the lighter side to highlight the delicate side of coffee - florals and high fruit flavors are most of what we seek in a cup of coffee.\n\nIn 2018 we launched an office coffee subscription program in an attempt to get better coffee into offices with the same level of education and care we've shown to the rest of our customers. We also designed a very simple ordering platform which lets you place a recurring order once and only worry about it if you need to modify an upcoming order.",

Reily operates a wholesale grocery business in Monroe, Louisiana.

With 85% of all imported coffee beans passing through New Orleans, they assure themselves of having the first choice of the finest beans available. As the company’s reputation for quality grows, tea is added to the product line.\nMr. Reily develops the first tea ever specially blended for pouring over ice. Luzianne® helps popularize iced tea as a cool way to beat the Southern heat, and its reputation for clear, smooth-tasting, refreshing iced tea is soon established across the South.\nReily Foods Company continues to manufacture and market the highest quality coffee and tea brands as well as mayonnaise, cake flour, sauces, chili seasonings, salad dressings, and brownie mixes throughout the U.S. and, for select products, internationally.

It was soon becoming clear that our profile and story was developing a following and everything roasted was sold every week!  We decided to make it legal and officially open as a coffee roaster here in the US, still keeping our plans to open in Scotland when the door opens. We're dedicated to NOT burning our beans. Rather, we bring out the best flavors our origins have to offer. Not only do we offer our products in whole-bean or ground, we also offer pods. Our pods contain a barista-dose of 14g of fresh coffee. Most national brands only pack 6-10g and it's nowhere close to being fresh. We grind and pack our pods the same day. Each pod has a valve to allow the CO2 to escape without allowing oxygen to get in. We call these \"Super Pods\" and they're well worth it!  \n\nWe're not coffee snobs. We encourage everyone to \"Drink the Coffee YOU Like!\"  Add cream, add sugar, make it the way you like your drink. We believe that coffee is to be enjoyed and bless your day with a boost!  May you be blessed with every cup purchased, and every sip taken. *Orders in NW Arkansas have free delivery upon request.",

A careful light roast gives our coffee its wonderful aroma. A hint of fruit, a full load of chocolate!\n\n\nOUR  MISSION\nCoffee is part of our everyday, but is harvested only once a year. While it can be consumed at every street corner, it needs to be shipped from exotic far away places around the equator. Often reduced to only a small part of a large milk beverage, coffee when rightly treated has more aromas than wine. Coffee is truly special. This is why we produce a specialty coffee beverage that can be enjoyed in its purest form.\n\nOur green coffees are carefully selected, then precisely roasted to their full potential, professionally brewed by us and finally neatly packaged. Connecting the origin and the consumer, giving coffee the elegance and appreciation it deserves.\n\n\nCOLD BREW FOR YOU\nWe also produce cold brew for roasteries and brands within Germany and Europe.",

    "description": "Landwer Coffee is one of Israel's leading coffee company. \nManufacturer, distributer, importer and exporter of Turkish and Espresso coffee. \n\nIn 1919 Moshe Landwer opened a small coffee bar in the center of Berlin that quickly became a popular meeting place. In addition to the coffee bar, the family also operated a small coffee roasting facility. \nIn 1933 when the Nazis came to power in Germany, the family decided to immigrate to Israel. Immediately after their arrival to Tel-Aviv, the Landwer family opened their first coffee roasting plant in the famous Alenbi Street. Later, when the business expanded, the family moved the coffee bar to 123 Alenbi Street.\n\nIn the 40's and 50's \"Landwer Coffee\" became the most popular brand in Israel. During the strict austerity times of the 50's, when the Finance Minister, Mr. Dov Yosef, encouraged cheap replacement Items like \"Chicory\", Landwer kept selling its high quality, real coffee blends. \nIn view of the growing demand, in 1964 the production facilities were moved again and this time to the industrial zone of Holon, where it is still located today utilizing about 1000 square Meter. \n\nIn the early 80's, the Federman family acquired Landwer Coffee.\n\nThe company is continuing a conservative and strict quality control policy. Well aware of the challenges of the 21st century, the firm responded vigorously in recent years by investing in new production lines, rebranding and expanding distribution to new geographic areas.",

    "description": "Roasting coffee is as much art as science. We began roasting a few years ago, roasting and burning through air poppers, but gaining the ear and nose for a perfect roast. After continual tweaks and hacks, we invested in a small home roaster and began roasting coffee for family and friends. They encouraged us to produce our coffee commercially. We use a 1kg fluid bed and computer controlled roaster for consistency and quality. Each roast is carefully tracked and monitored by temperature, with attention to the best flavor development for the particular coffee.\r\n\r\nWe roast on-demand, usually on Mondays and Fridays. Coffee is shipped USPS and arrives on your doorstep at the beginning of its peak flavor. By comparison, your local coffee chain’s coffee has an expiration of 6 months from its roasting. Even the costly boutique coffee will typically be weeks to months old.\r\n\r\nIf haven’t tasted a micro-roast yet, the proof will be in your cup. Every batch is unique, often seasonal, and always fearlessly roasted for you. Enjoy!",

    "description": "At the heart of the BW Blacksmith Coffee Company lies family. Anything and everything we do, we do together as a family here at BW. For years, we have been a DIY family. From building coffee tables to building homes, together, we have done it all. Our passion for working together, handcrafting quality products, and creating memories along the way was instilled in us by our grandpa, Bernard Camille Willems, or as he was known to those around him, Ben. Grandpa Ben was an incredible man in every sense of the word. He was a true craftsman who took deep pride in his work, possessed a desire to always go the extra mile, was firmly grounded (steady, unyielding?) in his faith, and had a true love for his family. He loved spending time working on projects together, sharing in the special memories and making sure the work days were never dull and full of silly moments! He was an avid collector of tools and parts from years gone by, especially pieces that reflect the working man’s history and early American grit and ingenuity. In his last few years, he became passionate about blacksmithing and even built a working blacksmith shop that was his pride and joy. Unfortunately, he passed away before being able to really start working on his blacksmith projects after being diagnosed with cancer. His passing has driven us to carry on his legacy, share with others all of the values he so diligently impressed upon us, and given us a desire (eagerness, commitment?) to lend a helping hand to those fighting cancer and their families. Thus, BW Blacksmith Coffee Co. was born. A percentage of all proceeds go directly to victims of cancer and their families to help them defeat this terrible disease. In his memory, we turned B.W. Blacksmith into a brand to allow his enthusiasm for hard work, family, friends, and faith in God to live on.",

    "description": "HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?\nOur mission is a blend of different ingredients – specially crafted to empower you to identify what you truly need to be happy and what you want to be fulfilled. Through a special mixture of goal-setting, we help navigate you in your journey to success by utilizing the Enneagram system, Agile methodology, and data analytics. We believe that by understanding how you think, how you feel, and how you behave….your relationships (old & new) will be enhanced, thus enabling you to become both professionally satisfied and personally fulfilled – in other words: to be happy & feel successful.\n\nWHY COFFEE? WHY PAIR COFFEE WITH COACHING & CONSULTING?\nIndeed a very unusual combination. Our founder, Linda Brewster, has a lifelong passion for coffee. Even before Linda fell in love with strategic planning & leadership development while earning her MBA in Finance, she loved coffee. Her grandparents owned a bakery/coffeeshop and her earliest childhood memories are around the kitchen table with family drinking coffee, and Linda was awestruck by a few things about coffee:\n\nHow coffee brings people together locally to share much-needed breaks from our increasingly frenetic lifestyles.\nThat coffee is global – lets us touch people from around the Earth. The World Bank estimates that coffee is the largest employer on the planet, with 500 million people directly or indirectly involved in the coffee trade.\nCaffeine makes people (and goats) have energy to think clearly and to “get things done!”\nMost people don’t understand specialty coffee or how to brew better coffee – and how this will not only enhance their coffee experience and relationship, but also improve the livelihood of millions in developing countries.\n\n\nSo, again, why Coffee? No other reason than our founder, Linda, loves coffee and truly believes that her extraordinary homegrown recipe can help us help you, your family, your friends, your company, and your community.",

    "description": "AC Horn Manufacturing - BUILT TO LAST\r\n\r\nIt all started in a modest garage in Texas in 1907. Yet it wasn’t until 1946, when a young A.C. “Ace” Horn took over his father’s small sheet metal operation, that the company we know today began to take shape. Ace didn’t know what would become of his new enterprise, but he did know how he wanted things done. He believed that a business, like any person, was only as good as its word. So, he set out to build a company he could be proud of––one that offered genuine quality, delivered on its promises and stood by its work.\r\n\r\nAll these years later, Horn has evolved into a worldwide leader in processing equipment for the snack food industry. There’s no denying times have changed, but Ace’s guiding principles are as relevant today as ever.\r\n\r\nSavvy food processors have come to know Horn for integrity in everything we do. Unsurprisingly, it starts with the equipment we build. Each piece is made with the kind of good, honest craftsmanship that’s just not found in competitive products. We use only the very best parts, the most carefully thought out design, and we never take shortcuts. It’s what makes our equipment the most reliable––and trusted––in the industry.\r\n\r\nToday, the Horn product line features best-in-class nut roasters and popcorn poppers, plus top-quality equipment for milling, peanut blanching and the packaging room. We offer capabilities to customize certain machines and boast a well-respected, highly efficient job shop center. It all combines to make Horn an invaluable partner for snack food producers around the globe.\r\n\r\nSmaller manufacturers depend on us. Some of the world’s largest corporations do too.\r\n\r\nIt’s safe to say Ace would be proud of what his company has become. One built on integrity whose values always shine through. We’ll keep striving to craft the best machinery around, following through on our commitment to our customers, and going above and beyond to earn their trust.",

Approximately 80 percent of people facing hunger live in rural areas of the Global South and often work in the agricultural sector—including smallholders, farmers and landless labourers (Global Hunger Index 2022). \n\nThe Food Security Standard (FSS) aims to support the private sector's effort to improve social sustainability and end hunger for farmers, workers and neighbouring communities. It seeks to realize the right to adequate food through the responsible production and global trade of agricultural commodities. The FSS complements existing sustainability standards by providing a holistic approach to the human right to food through a practical toolbox and measurable criteria designed to be applied to all agricultural products, farm sizes and business forms. \n\nThe FSS was developed in 2017 as a cooperation of the Center for Development Research (University of Bonn, Germany) and the NGOs Welthungerhilfe (Bonn, Germany) and WWF (Berlin, Germany). It is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Food and Agriculture (BMEL) via the agency \"Fachagentur Nachwachsende Rohstoffe\".

    "description": "Santos & Knafla is a German-Portuguese coffee manufacturer with its headquarters in a former roasters in Coimbra, Portugal.\nWe had the great opportunity to take over the well maintained roasting facilities as well as some “ancient” machinery, where coffee was roasted over an open wood fire. This is a kind of museum and gives you an idea about what coffee roasting was like in former days.\nSo, we are also happy to have a new gas fired drum roaster and the hygienic conditions in the actual roasting facility. The standard procedures from HACCP (Hazard Analysis und Critical Control Point) helps us to maintain the high requirements in production of coffee.\n\nIn Santos & Knafla we agreed to keep up the old tradition of slow and careful roasting in drum roaster. Compared to industrial roasting with high amounts of beans roasted in a few minutes we take our time. The roasting takes about 20 minutes and our roast master has been roasting coffee for 42 years. He is a real expert, checking the roasting grade every few moments prior to the end of the roasting. The smell, the “cracking” sound of the beans and his knowledge of the origins of the beans enables him to perform a perfect roast on the individual blends.\nWith such opportunities, we decided to get involved in the fantastic world of coffee roasting.\n\nThe idea behind our young company Santos & Knafla is to maintain the traditional way of Portuguese Coffee Culture and add some modern influences.\nThis is already expressed in the different packages. Having a Retro-look in the Café Santos blends and a fresh, modern appearance in the Santos & Knafla Coffees.\nThe philosophy of Santos & Knafla is to produce a fresh coffee as it is known in Portugal and other south Mediterranean parts of different countries. This means strong body and great crema on the espresso without any additives and a manifold of aromas.\nA high quality coffee for a reasonable price!",

There is New York Tradition in every cup and Aloha in every sip. \n\nWe globally source the highest quality, specialty-grade coffee beans available throughout the world.

Towards this philosophy, we source specialty grade coffees with Rainforest Alliance certification to ensure comprehensive sustainable farm management that protects the environment for future generations of coffee growers. By partnering with these producers, we are providing the highest quality coffees, while reinforcing our commitment to the farmers and the environment. \n \nIn addition to carefully selecting the origin of our coffees, we roast our coffee to order and then package and ship the coffee the same day. Our goal is to ensure that our customers receive only the freshest, perfectly roasted, coffee possible.\n\nCity Girl Coffee Company was launched November of 2015 by Alakef Coffee Roasters. City Girl is a sustainable and responsible coffee company working to bring awareness and equality to the women of the coffee industry.

It's the launch pad where we decide the direction of the coffee.\n\nWhen opened Turning Point Coffee Roasters in 2018, it also marked a 'turning point' in our careers: from the wine industry to small business owners in the coffee industry.\n\nInitially, roasting coffee was a hobby that started with a one-pound bag of green coffee toasted in a popcorn popper. Soon, there was a commercial coffee roaster in our garage, and eventually, a full-scale roastery, cafe, and third-wave coffee community in Southern Connecticut was born.\n\nThrough those early trials, we developed a philosophy inspired by our previous careers. We aim to roaster coffee like the best wines are made, by sourcing the highest quality ingredients and doing as little as possible so their character can shine. As with wine, we explore new varieties, find different single origins and look for the character that makes coffees unique to the farm they came from: terroir.\n\nWe hope to provide a Turning Point in how you drink, enjoy and appreciate your coffee!",

At GreenToken we know this approach doesn't work for raw materials or 2 reasons -\n\n1) Raw materials ship and store in bulk and are often commingled (mixed up) at the first and later points of aggregation.\n\n2) Even if batch identifiers for certain quantities are known, constant commingling and smaller off-takes lead to an n! (n-factorial) number of records that potential need to be kept . A supply chain with 15 sources of raw material can have 15! (1.3 followed by 12 zeros) possible combinations - no batch system is able to track this complexity - we know, our customers have tried!\n\nWith GreenToken, companies that need to source raw materials can now accurately report on sustainable or ethical procurement, even if the materials are mixed or blended. This allows our customers to make informed decisions on where to source and prove to interesting parties that they are sourcing responsibly.\n\nWhats more, GreenToken can be used to measure the level of certain raw materials in finished goods. Let's say you want to prove to the world that your consumer products have a high volume of recycled polymers in the products themselves or in the packaging. This is a hard problem to solve in an n-tier batch based raw material supply chain for which GreenToken has an elegant solution! Contact us for more information..",

We refuse to use any preservatives. Our yogurt contains no artificial flavors, artificial sweeteners, or preservatives. \n\nIt has been a busy 10 years for Chobani. Along our journey, we’ve constantly innovated our offerings to evolve with customer tastes and preferences, leading with values, and putting our people first. \n\nAs we look to the future, Chobani is reinvigorating its founding mission with a vision to make universal wellness happen sooner using food as a force of good. \n\nOur vision builds on the company's founding mission to provide better food for more people, while laying out how Chobani is defining wellness and where the brand will invest to achieve it:\n•\tNutritional Wellness: Scaling our efforts to provide better food for more people.\n•\tSocial Wellness: Increasing our investment in the communities we serve and the people who craft our food.\n•\tEnvironmental Wellness: Building a supply chain that ensures the planet's health.\n\nThis evolution supports Chobani’s ambition to become a food-focused wellness company and providing better food to all people.

We are proud to offer a full line of specialty roasted coffees for a coffee experience that is unsurpassed.\n\nOur family coffee farm is perched high in the Antioquia mountains between the elevations of 5,500 and 6,500 feet, offering an ideal location for coffee growing in the region’s rich volcanic soil.

    "description": "When things are humming at our 6,000 square-foot quality coffee roastery and lab in Jacksonville, FL and we’re lost in the dull roar of our 35 kg Loring, it can be easy to forget about our quieter beginnings. \n\nOur story started over 10 years ago as just a hobby in a garage when award-winning journalist and magazine editor Jay Burnett realized that coffee could be more than just a reporter’s best friend. An early adopter to what’s now known as “third wave” coffee, Burnett has since handed off his beloved hobby to family and friends, and today, Bold Bean Coffee is full-fledged business with three retail locations and a dedicated team in constant pursuit of quality. More than just an endeavor to find the perfect balance of sweetness, acidity and body in a single cup, Bold Bean is a way to develop meaningful relationships - not only with our fellow coffee drinkers at the tail of the St. Johns River, but also with our producing partners in every country where we source coffee - from Colombia to Ethiopia to Guatemala.\n\nThroughout the year, we travel to coffee origins to learn from our producer partners, to listen to them and understand their realities. For Bold Bean, there is a strong correlation between good coffee, good relationships and a good story. That is why, at the core of our business strategy, we believe in good storytelling built around sharing - sharing information, conversation, the occasional laugh, and, above all, the value and lessons found in a quality cup of coffee. When we do our job right, all of these blend harmoniously into a delicious cup - and with any luck, a good story. It was true more than a decade ago, when Jay cooled down from the day’s news cycle to roast away the evening hours in the garage. It’s still true today at our north Florida headquarters where the Bold Bean team sorts through the red hot logistics of a sprawling global supply chain, bringing carefully sourced and roasted coffee to a growing legion of specialty coffee consumers.\n",

The idea of selling our own roasts didn't occur to us until we noticed our local farmers’ market had none to offer. When we saw the need was the same in other markets, we were compelled to bridge the gap. Within a year, we found ourselves in the middle of a flourishing coffee roasting business, complete with professional roasters and a new commercial space.\n\nOUR NAME\nThe company name came about because all the work was initially done in our backyard. The logo is also significant because the initials of Laura L. Adams and Matt Adams spell “L.L.A.M.A.” \n\nOur name and logo together reflect the hard work and dedication that goes into creating superior coffee. In many ways, Backyard Beans is a labor of love.\n\nOUR RESPONSIBILITY\nWe only purchase superior, responsibly sourced coffee beans. Working with an importer to source sustainably grown coffee from around the world is something in which we take great pride. Great coffee begins at the heart, with hard-working farmers and co-ops. By sourcing, we’re doing our part to secure a sustainable future.\n\nYou can find Backyard Beans at local farmers’ markets and nearly 100 retail/restaurant locations. We are thankful for the businesses and individuals who love and serve Backyard Beans Coffee at their table. Always responsibly sourced and remarkably roasted. ",

Their travels took them out west and they discovered a rare process called air roasting. This unique process takes the chaff, or outer husk of the coffee bean out of the roast as it’s cooking, producing a non-bitter, smooth tasting, clean bean. Working like Mad Scientists, using this air roasting process and their knowledge of blends they experimented using the finest 100% organic, fair trade certified beans, from around the world. Born from their passion and experimentation the original Fogbuster Blend was created. They began offering this masterpiece blend to the community and it became an instant success. From those humble roots the Pierce Bros have grown to be recognized as the gold standard in coffee. The Pierce Bros believe in always drinking responsibly which is why all their coffee beans are 100% certified Organic and Fair Trade. Pierce Bros Coffee can be found at all Big Y and Whole Foods Supermarkets; and if you’re interested in offering Pierce Bros Coffee in your own family, business establishment. We look forward to talking with you.\n\nDrink Responsibly My Friends; Air Roasted, Fair Trade and Organic!",

    "description": "We've been developing eCommerce software since 2005. Back then, we introduced the multivendor marketplace software that has now become the leading self-hosted multivendor solution on the market. CS-Cart Multi-Vendor, the award-winning marketplace platform, is now our flagship product. It was featured on the world's most popular software review and comparison websites such as SourceForge, Capterra, Crozdesk, and others as the leading marketplace software in 2020 and 2021.\n\nOnline marketplaces are the main force in eCommerce now. These types of online multivendor sales platforms have taken over a huge share of the market and influenced the online shopping experience dramatically. Customers got used to shopping on large marketplaces such as Amazon: they anticipate a large product range, competitive prices, and excellent customer service and buying experience. That's why we put much effort into developing the best multivendor marketplace software system that meets online shopping trends and customer buying behavior.\n\nCS-Cart Multi-Vendor is an on-premise licensed software. But we kept the source code open for maximum customizability and scalability. That's why CS-Cart Multi-Vendor is so adored by large companies that develop custom marketplaces. But it doesn't mean that you can't open a small niche multi vendor eCommerce website on our marketplace software: there are hundreds of niche marketplaces on CS-Cart—be sure to check the \"Clients\" section on our website. CS-Cart Multi-Vendor comes in various editions that make it suitable for both SMEs and Enterprises.\n\nTo keep making our online marketplace solution better, so that it meets fast-changing client's needs, we have a dedicated development team and a customer care team, aside from marketing and sales departments. Among the developers, we have talented PHP programmers, JS-experts, and other pros that literally can do magic. And we're constantly looking for talented professionals.",

Thomas Group) is a family owned, professionally managed group of companies with its headquarters in Chennai, India.\n\n​\n\nIn 1925, a young Indian entrepreneur, Alfred Vedam Thomas, bought 100 hectares of grassland in Pasuparai, Tamil Nadu, considered completely unsuitable to grow tea. At a time when plantations were strictly under the jurisdiction of the British, A.V. Thomas went on to not only transform Pasuparai into one of the highest yielding tea plantations in the nation, but also to become the first Indian to own a plantation company. Thus the AVT Group was born.\n\nWith this entrepreneurial spirit, AVT ventured into multiple new business areas to meet rapidly changing needs in India and beyond. In addition to plantations, the company's portfolio now includes Consumer Products, Natural Food Ingredients, Nutraceuticals and Leather Products.\n\n​\n\nA.V. Thomas Leather & Allied Products Private Limited, part of The AVT Group is the largest small leather goods manufacturer in India, producing high quality hand crafted leather goods.

    "description": "Tea was discovered in China and for hundreds of years, remained a Chinese beverage. Tea grew in popularity in Asia and made its way to Europe and England in the 16th century. In the 1830s, the British East India Company became concerned about the Chinese monopoly on tea, which constituted most of its trade and supported the enormous consumption of tea in Great Britain. The British colonists discovered tea growing wild in Assam and in the 1850s started cultivating tea plantations locally.\n\nHistorically Indians viewed tea as a herbal medicine rather than as a recreational beverage so consumption of black tea within India remained low until the promotional campaign by the British in the early 20th century, which encouraged factories, mines, and textile mills to provide tea breaks for their workers. Since then, tea has became a big part of the Indian culture.\n\nAround the same time, in 1940s, we had our humble beginnings in the tea business, trading teas in Calcutta, India. We truly believed that tea with all its inherent benefits could change the world. We acquired tea plantations in India and became one of the first companies to export packaged teas from India in early 1980s.\n\nIn 1979, after years working with his family’s Indian tea business, our founder left for the US on a mission to bring premium quality black tea to the US market.\n\nUpon arrival in the US, he saw success supplying private label teas to major grocery chains in the country but noticed a gap in the market: The majority of teas available in the US were grown and blended to suit the needs of iced tea but there was nothing that fit the unique taste of spiced Indian chai that Indian consumers cared for. Seeing an untapped market for premium quality tea, we created Tea India®. We wanted to capture the true quality, taste, and experience of Indian chai in our product, so we went to the source: Assam.",

The result is an innovative, sophisticated fully automatic coffee machine, which is unique due to its modular construction. This principle ensures maximum service friendliness and combines ease of use with the highest product quality. The advantages of this construction, as well as the high reliability are well known far beyond the Swiss borders. \n\nAs another innovative world premiere, Thermoplan developed in 2007 as the first company a revolutionary milk system which prepares beside hot milk foam for cappuccino and latte macchiato, cold milk foam at the touch of a button. This innovative system is leading till today and is used in all Thermoplan Black&White coffee machines. \n\nThermoplan is a “Swiss-made” operation and is rooted in Central Switzerland. Representing an export share of over 97%, Thermoplan is delivering its high quality products in more than 75 countries. About 420 employees are employed at the headquarters in Weggis (CH) and subsidiaries in Germany and the United States.\n",

Eilenberger's parents left their home in Leipzig, Germany and sailed to America to pursue their dream in the new land of opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn May of 1898, young 21-year-old F. H. opened a bakery in tiny Palestine, Texas. Along with his hopes and dreams, F. H. also tucked away an old family recipe for fruitcake. Using that recipe, the finest ingredients available, and some old world know-how, his fruitcake became a delicious success.\r\n\r\nAs more and more people bought his cakes, the Eilenberger's reputation of having the freshest, highest quality bakery products began to grow.\r\n\r\nDespite a devastating fire, the Depression years and two World Wars, the business thrived.\r\n\r\nJust as it was in F.H.'s day, we use nothing but the finest ingredients and insist that every cake be made the old-fashioned way-lovingly mixed, baked and decorated entirely by hand. Sure it's more time-consuming, but we think our people, not machinery, are the only ones qualified to deem a product perfect. It's this unique hands-on\" approach to quality that's made Eilenberger's baked goods a holiday tradition for over 119 years.\r\n\r\nMuch has changed in the last century, but our commitment to quality has never waned. In fact, we guarantee your Eilenberger favorites will arrive bakery fresh and meet your strict standards or we'll make it right.

Coffee is one of the most widely-traded commodities in the world and the chemicals used in conventional non-organic farming practices in many countries are extremely harmful to the farmers and to the environment.This vision also led to Cafe Virtuoso’s commitment to the success of its partners by providing the highest standards of detailed personalized service and extensive ongoing training and education set by the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA), the world's largest coffee trade association formed with the purpose of establishing the de-facto benchmarks for the specialty coffee industry.",

    "description": "Three Keys Coffee is a family-owned craft coffee roastery that offers a multi-sensory coffee experience through taste, sight, and sound. Founded by Tio and Kenzel Fallen, Three Keys Coffee explores the connection between art, music, and coffee through vibrant bag design, curated Spotify playlists to pair with each roast, and top-quality, award-winning coffee.\n\nThree Keys takes its inspiration from Jazz, deriving its name from the valves of the trumpet—an instrument of simplicity that uses just three keys to produce notes across a creative and complex range of tonal outputs. \n\nThe trumpet is a personal connection to our origin story, with co-founder Tio Fallen having played the trumpet for over 15 years including for the renowned FAMU Marching 100. Coffee became a passion for both Tio and his wife/co-founder, Kenzel after traveling to coffee-producing regions and exploring the art of home-roasting. Tio has a professional background in mechanical engineering so he was intrigued by the science of roasting but also drawn to the art of creating coffee, reminiscent of the artistic freedom and creativity of creating music. \n\nThree Keys Coffee has been consumed in over 500 cities within all 50 states, as well as internationally. We have been featured in Bloomberg, Sprudge, Food & Wine, Fortune, NBC News, Katie Couric Online, and Imbibe magazine. Currently available for purchase at Trader Joe's, Central Market, and at www.threekeyscoffee.com",

The lifelong desire to promote products from African farmers fueled the passion to create Asami. Africa, despite its rich Agri-resources is lost in the value chain; the origin stories are often lost as seen in cocoa, coffee and teas. With so many intermediaries, small holder farmers and tea or cocoa loving consumers are the losers. We are sourcing directly from the small holder farmers putting more in their pockets and communities. We connect African farmers to consumers to deliver essential value-added food and beverages to the world.\n\nDo you know? Ghana and Cote D’Ivoire are Top 1 and 2 producers of cocoa beans worldwide but are not on the map for processed cocoa? When you mention teas; most think of Asian origins such as China and India for example. However, Africa also holds its place when talking about tea cultivation and production, however that origin story is often lost to Export Trading Companies and Big distributors; losing visibility to African countries of origin like Kenya, Rwanda, Malawi, South Africa etc. and their farmers in the global value chain of teas. Africa produces about 12% of the world’s coffee supply, with much of it coming from East Africa. This incredible region has the perfect climate and soil conditions to produce luxurious, rich flavors. Did you know Ethiopia is considered to be the birthplace of coffee. Yes Coffee’s Roots Are In Africa. Ethiopia (39%) and Uganda (23%) account for 62% of coffee bean distribution\n\nOur partner farmers all over Africa regularly update us on tea, cocoa and coffee production and farm life when we can’t be there ourselves. They believe in transparency and share our vision and values about changing the way tea, cocoa and coffee are produced, marketed and consumed. Your purchase brings income to thousands of African farmers. ",

To that end, we pursue relationships with everyone from the producers of our coffee, to our wholesale partners, suppliers, community, and guests. We seek coffees that have a uniqueness or a special characteristic about them, and we try to be as transparent as possible. By providing you information on the region, district, elevation, processing, etc.; we hope to give you a glimpse into the story of your coffee, and the long journey it has made.\n\nWe roast with a philosophy we call exposure roasting.\n\nThe idea is to roast the coffee seeds just long enough to highlight the inherently unique characteristics without roasting over these characteristics. We believe that this lighter roast allows for a better ability to distinguish — via taste — the nuances that various processing, varieties, and regions have on coffee. Exposure roasting aims to honor and highlight all the hard work the producers put into making their coffee delicious.\n\nAt our coffee bars we brew our coffee honestly, that means with intention and innovation, viewing coffee as both an art and a science. We use a modern menu and beautiful glassware that highlight the coffees and beverages that we serve. Whether you are looking to spend some time in our intimate cafes, or taking a cup to go, we promise unparalleled hospitality and a delicious beverage.

We choose organic coffee beans from around the world, roast and grind them in Italy, and create blends that delight any coffee drinker’s palate. With our curated selection of coffee pods, you can make any espresso-based drink conveniently at home or in the office. \n\nTHE BUSINESS MODEL \n\nWe believe so strongly in the quality of our coffee that we give you the coffee machine for free. After you fall in love with our coffee, our subscription service delivers coffee to your doorstep. Our D2C model, elevated by our user-friendly interface, allows customers to choose and edit their personalized coffee subscription at the click of a button. \n\nTHE ORIGIN STORY \n\nSon of a Barista was founded by an Italian immigrant who wanted to enjoy great coffee the way he had done growing up in Italy. He went back to his roots to recreate what was missing on the American coffee market. Trained as an engineer, he understood that precise steam pressure and the exact amount of coffee are needed to create the perfect cup of coffee.\n\nTHE CUSTOMERS \n\nWe were conceived in the digital age where people’s shopping habits have been revolutionized. The days of trotting around massive flagship stores for coffee no longer suits the modern consumer’s busy schedule. Our customers demand high quality and convenience. And that’s what Son of a Barista gives them. \n\nTHE B2B EXPERIENCE \n\nSon of a Barista also offers industrial coffee machines and provides our full range of coffees to meet the specific needs of hotels, restaurants, and business customers. Our B2B solutions enable your company to offer the perfect cup of coffee to your guests, customers, and clients, every time. \n\nSon of a Barista will give you the taste experience of a professional barista brewing and serving your coffee, just like in Italy.

In 2013 the FTA led the Save DC Food Trucks campaign that defeated a proposal to shut out food trucks from most of downtown. Since then the FTA has been at the forefront of removing obstacles to vending and promoting mobile entrepreneurship across the Washington metropolitan area, working to pass new food truck laws in the City of Alexandria as well as in Fairfax, Montgomery and Prince George’s counties. In 2015 the FTA successfully worked to lift a statewide ban that prohibited food trucks on state-maintained roads and streets in Virginia. \r\n\r\nAt the same time the FTA has championed vendor education and professional development and produces the Capital City Food Truck Convention, the only food truck conference and trade show in the Atlantic region. The FTA organizes some of the region’s most popular food truck events including its annual signature festival Curbside Cookoff. \r\n\r\nToday the FTA represents more than 100 food truck small businesses across the DMV and totals more than 15,000 supporters. \r\n\r\nThe FTA is a proud supporter of Children’s Charities, DC Central Kitchen, Miriam’s Kitchen, Mid-County United Ministries, and No Kid Hungry.

In the United States, heating and cooling account for more than 25 percent of total energy use across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors at a cost of $270 billion annually.\n\nDespite its large energy and carbon footprint and its significant potential to reduce carbon emissions, the use of renewable energy for heating and cooling applications, including biomass, biogas, geothermal, landfill gas, renewable electrification, renewable hydrogen, and solar thermal, has received relatively little attention compared with renewable electricity.\n\nThe Renewable Thermal Collaborative (RTC) serves as the leading coalition for organizations that are committed to scaling up renewable heating and cooling at their facilities and dramatically cutting carbon emissions. RTC members recognize the growing demand and necessity for renewable heating and cooling and the urgent need to meet this demand in a manner that delivers sustainable, cost-competitive options at scale.\n\nThe Renewable Thermal Collaborative is facilitated by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, David Gardiner and Associates, and World Wildlife Fund.",

    "description": "Karst Organics sources organically grown, single origin green coffee beans directly from East Timor (Timor-Leste), to be exported to the UK and Europe. Established in 2017, our aim is to provide coffee roasters with a specialty product whilst also committing to pay a truly fair price to our partner farmers in order to facilitate a more sustainable and consistent model of income. \n\nHaving listened to our partner farmers, we identified focussed areas for support in processing, storage facilities and improved water supply. In late 2018, construction began on a centralised processing facility allowing for greater control of consistency and quality. Following which, a warehouse was built to facilitate better parchment storage. Finally, in March 2019, new piping was laid to provide improved water supply, not only to the centralised processing facility but also to a number of domestic households. \n\nA major factor contributing towards the increase in the quality of our coffee is through the development of targeted training sessions. These allow farmers to come together and learn from knowledgeable coffee advisors and also from each other. By encouraging better communication between farmers, this will benefit the local industry as a whole, as greater transparency and awareness of the specialty sector will encourage the farmers to implement more controlled processing methods thereby resulting in wider opportunities within more international markets. \n\nKarst Organics is unique as we are at origin and hands-on throughout the whole process; from the moment the cherries are picked to the moment when the green beans are packed and sealed ready for export to the UK. With full transparency and traceability, buyers can have the confidence in truly knowing where our green beans come from and who has been involved during each step of the process. \n\nWe are proud to have established partnerships with our farmers which will in the long-term provide a more sustainable and consistent inco",

    "description": "The Simple Green® story began nearly 50 years ago, long before \"environmentally friendly\"​ products were mandated by law. Bruce FaBrizio and his father developed a safer alternative to the toxic cleaners being used to remove tannic acid, a by-product of coffee roasting, from roasting machinery. It took three years to perfect the biodegradable, not-toxic, non-flammable, non-abrasive formula. After its initial success, Bruce began selling Simple Green to automotive and industrial customers in 55-gallon drums; which he delivered in his van, for use as a cleaner on equipment and floors.\n\nIn 1979, just as initial retail marketing efforts were beginning to pay off, Bruce's father died. Bruce managed to keep the business alive and in 1981 gave his company the name it continues to carry — Sunshine Makers, Inc. Simple Green was then introduced nationally into several new markets including Hardware/Do It Yourself, consumer grocery & drug, GSA (government) and Club-Store classes of trade. \n\nIn the early 1990s, Bruce created the Environmental Technology Division within his company in order to define the cutting edge of today's cleaning solutions and solidify his company's high standards for environmental responsibility.Today, millions of dollars have been spent to prove the safety and efficacy claims of Simple Green. Sunshine Makers, Inc. is still owned and operated by Bruce P. FaBrizio. \n\nOriginal Simple Green and the entire family of Simple Green products are a part of everyday life in millions of homes, commercial and industrial sites, not only in the United States but all over the world. Sunshine Makers, Inc. has its headquarters in Huntington Beach, California, with satellite offices all over the world. Simple Green is manufactured in Garden Grove, California; Lawrenceville, Georgia; Rydalmere, Australia and Bernburg, Germany. Additional distribution centers are located in Maastricht, Netherlands and Choisy le Roi, France.",

    "description": "it all began in a garden.\nFounder and CEO Michael Heinrich was in his grandmother’s garden in Germany when he learned about the power of food. An avid gardener and medical doctor, his grandmother taught him how to use food to fuel his mind and body. Michael initially pushed the lessons to the back of his thoughts as he began a career in finance. Quickly he discovered corporate culture prizes productivity over health. Michael found this perspective flawed, remembered his grandmother’s advice and put his own healthful ideas into practice. They worked.\n\nResearch has since proven that health and productivity go hand in hand, and the more healthful foods people consume during the day, the happier, more engaged, and creative they become. Supported with research, nutritionists, chefs and a mission, Michael founded Oh My Green. Healthful food became the foundation of our company, just as it’s the foundation for growth, creativity, productivity and happiness in our work and lives. Today that mission has expanded to bring in wellbeing through meditation, mindfulness and community events. And Oh My Green is now garten, the German word for “garden.”",

Mono products have become part of permanent museum collections of modern and applied art.

In 1959 the brand Mono was established with the introduction of Mono A.\n\nMuch has changed since then, and much has remained the same in the production process at Mono.

The surrounding fruit is discarded, often dumped into rivers or left to rot in heaps. So we invented something better to do with it. Something that’s better for everyone. For food & beverage companies, it is an all-natural, clean-label, nutrient-dense and distinctly flavorful ingredient as a sustainable found food. For farmers and families in coffee growing countries, it creates sustainable jobs and a new revenue source for some of the poorest areas of the world.

Over 8 billion plastic straws ALONE litter beaches and coastlines and threaten wildlife. It’s time we took a stand against plastic and switched to a nature-friendly alternative.\n\nWHAT WE DO: UrthPact is a contract manufacturer that specializes in the molding and assembly of compostable products made from renewable, nature-based bioplastics. Some of our 100% compostable products include straws, water bottles, caps, and labels, cutlery and coffee related products, including our compostable one-way degassing valves called evalv®. We are proudly 100% Made in the USA, from our materials to our manufacturing.\n\nOUR SOLUTION: Our products will provide you and your customers with all of the convenience of single-use products without the environmental guilt. They’re certified to compost in industrial facilities in under 3 months and, in the case of our straws, in your backyard in under 6 months. We recognize the need for single-use products, and have learned how to create a world where consumption leaves no footprint.\n\nOUR RESULTS: Our goal is to help keep 25 BILLION pieces of plastic from reaching oceans and landfills. As of the start of April 2020, we’ve already reached the 5.7 billion pieces mark. View the current count HERE: www.urthpact.com\n\nWHO WE CAN HELP: In the long run, we’re here to help the planet. We target our products toward brands and distributors who do not do their own manufacturing. We provide our products to these customers under their own private brand labels.\n\nHOW WE’LL HELP YOU: By providing our compostable products to your customers, you achieve sustainability initiatives internally, and support green initiatives worldwide. You can give your customers the satisfaction they expect at no extra cost to your company or the planet. Send us an inquiry to see how we can help you! → www.urthpact.com/contact/",

    "description": "The real estate business has changed in Palm Beach County and around the world. No longer do Realtors have exclusive control of all information about homes on the market. That information is now readily available to both the buying and selling public through the Internet. Today, most buyers are more likely to find their future home in Northern Palm Beach County -- Jupiter, Palm Beach, Palm Beach Gardens, North Palm Beach, Singer Island, Juno Beach, Tequesta or West Palm Beach -- online rather than in a newspaper. Indeed, surveys demonstrate that more than 90% of all home buyers use the Internet as a source for their new home search. Over 80% of recent buyers first found their home on the Internet. \r\n\r\nSo, our goal at Tauber Real Estate Services is to provide you with an abundance of information on homes for sale from Palm Beach to Jupiter Island -- information about hundreds of communities in many different price ranges; information about the numerous lifestyle opportunities there are available, from golf to boating to tennis to fishing; and information about the location of shops, restaurants, schools, grocery stores and coffee shops throughout the Northern Palm Beaches. \r\n\r\nAll of us at Tauber Real Estate Services will provide you with more than just that information. Our experience, expertise, knowledge, and commitment to the highest level of service will give you, our clients, a real and substantial competitive advantage. Our goal is to provide every one of our clients the ultimate real estate experience, whether they are a first time home buyer or buying or selling an upper bracket home. With our more than 30 years of experience and proven track record of success -- over $1 billion in sales -- we are uniquely positioned to make information work for you.",

    "description": "Camm Solutions is a greentech company that has developed the fully sustainable and commercially viable material solution CAMM to combat global (micro)plastic pollution and eliminate waste. \n\nCAMM represents a breakthrough in material science, copying nature's own processes. It's engineered to function like plastic, yet when it's time to decompose, it does so with care for the environment, integrating back into the ecosystem without leaving harmful traces. When laminated or extruded onto paper, CAMM rivals the properties of multilayer packaging. In the recycling process, the CAMM layer washes away, enabling complete paper fiber recovery – a stark contrast to typical packaging that retains microplastics.\n\nCamm Solutions was initiated by Christoph Bertsch, a serial entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience, who was driven to solve the microplastic problem for one of his other companies. The CAMM idea resulted out of that quest. Supported by a diverse international group of shareholders representing the full CAMM value chain from raw material to recycling, close to €50M were invested to develop patented CAMM formulations and launch sustainable game changers like CAMM airpillows and stretchfilm. Today, CAMM embodies a practical vision of sustainability, proving that innovative ideas can create real-world eco-friendly solutions.",

For us, it’s natural.\r\n\r\nWe’ve been a leader in the research and development of carotenoid-based products for the last two decades and we take that role very seriously. This means we approach everything we do with a sense of wonder and a driving desire to find the best possible outcome or create the highest-quality product.\r\n\r\nSometimes we begin with an actual seed (from one of our tomato farms) and sometimes we start with the seed of an idea—maybe a health-related concern or even a question that was posed by one of our scientists on a quick coffee break. No matter how the process starts, we always go through extensive and time-consuming testing procedures, studies, and periods of refinement before ever bringing anything to market.\r\n\r\nOur process takes a long time. And no, it’s not the easy way to do things. But when you’re fully committed to what you’re creating, you don’t mind putting in those extra hours, days, and years.\r\n\r\nAll of this work can lead any number of places. Sometimes it leads us to a brilliant and unexpected new discovery like our microencapsulation technique (which keeps ingredients stable and releases them slowly into the body) and of course all-new products (like our vegan-friendly red colorant). We devote ourselves fully to everything we make because manufacturing a proven-effective supplement isn’t enough. Our real hope is to improve industry standards by fostering a level of compassion and consciousness that all too often isn’t a part of the conversation.",

They appreciate how we slow roast our coffee in small batches, ensuring batches taste the same each time.\n\nEndicott has grown a following both in Washington state, other states, and even other countries.

We source all beans from independent farmers in Honduras, whose coffee-growing experience goes back generations. Reversing the industry-standard supply chain economy, we pay fair wages to growers and even re-invest our own profits back into our farms, freeing our farmers to do what they do best: diligent and meticulous, quality organic growing. \n\nOur farms are all located at high-altitudes of around 5,000ft, where trees’ slower maturation allows more time for their fruit to reach optimal sweetness. Just as careful in our harvest, we choose only the top 1% of beans, measuring the cherries’ sweetness with a refractometer and hand-plucking only the fruits that qualify between 18 and 20 degrees Brix. In the art of drying, each bean is carefully monitored to reach optimal condition without damage to flavor and integrity -- whether using sun-driven techniques like natural and honey, or the more standardized washed process. Because our farms are all micro-lots, and thus process beans only in microbatches, we commit never to value quantity over quality. \n\nThe Spirit Animal coffee that you receive is therefore the product of a different coffee industry, and the agent of a cultural change. It’s a new breed of café-- combining inspirational taste and sustainable reciprocity, for a stirring experience of proudly bold sipping. ",

PILATUS will leverage on the patented and already proven back-contacted\nsilicon heterojunction “tunnel-IBC” technology to ensure achieving its ambitious targets. PILATUS will prove a production capacity of 15 MW for M10 silicon wafers in Norway using polysilicon from Europe and demonstrate the feasibility of an expansion to 5 GW wafer production capacity.PILATUS’PV module pilot line will reach a minimum of 170 MW of annual production capacity, accompanied with 190 MW cell capacity that by itself adds 30% to the current\ntotal capacity for PV cell production in Europe. Combining inline metrology and outdoor monitoring with the support of Industry 4.0 concepts all along the production chain, the cells and modules fabricated on PILATUS’ pilot lines will be analysed and feedback provided to the manufacturing process to ensure reaching ≥ 90 % yield at the end of the project. With the goal to establish PV modules with high durability, PILATUS targets to demonstrate the way towards > 40 years product lifetime by gaining fundamental insights into the degradation mechanisms and providing mitigation solutions thanks to the inline and outdoor metrology units that will be developed in the scope of the project. Further, PILATUS will prove a reduced environmental footprint compared to current technologies by demonstrating modules fully made from recycled materials, eco-design practices to facilitate the dismantling of PV panels, and manufacturing plants compliant with environmental standards. In short, PILATUS will contribute to re-building a “made in Europe”, leading-edge, competitive PV industry with the entire value chain been retained in Europe, compliant to the latest environmental\nstandards, hence fostering the affordability, the security of supply, and the sustainability of the future EU low-carbon\nenergy system",

    "description": "We started American Canning to provide craft consumers greater access to the beverages they love most. Our equipment, supplies and mobile canning services break down barriers to packaging with low minimum quantities, affordable pricing, quick lead times and easy online ordering. We’re in it for the love of craft and helping beverage makers share their craft in cans!\n\nWHY WE CAN\nWe envision a marketplace where every beverage brand, no matter how big or small, can be represented in cans. Whether you're producing craft beer, wine, mead, cider, coffee, tea, kombucha, soda, water, juice, or any other delectable drink, we'd be honored to work with you.\n\nBRINGING CONVENIENCE TO CANNING\nOrdering supplies shouldn't be difficult. That's why we developed an e-commerce website and eliminated extravagant minimum order quantities. You can order as many or as few supplies as you want, whenever you need.\nWe stock most of our items to be able to ship the same day. For custom items such as shrink-sleeve cans, we work with a network of suppliers to ensure you receive the fastest and most cost effective delivery possible. \n\nLOW COST PRODUCTS, HIGH QUALITY SERVICE\nAffordable pricing doesn't mean cheap customer service. In fact, it's just the opposite. We're committed to ensuring you have the highest quality experience with our team. If there is ever anything we can do to improve the process, drop us a line and let us know. Together, we can. That's our commitment to being your packaging partner.\n\nWe're headquartered in Austin, Texas, USA, but we work with customers throughout the globe. Regardless of where you are or what beverage you produce, we're committed to being a valuable resource for you and your brand(s).",

    "description": "BBG has solved many environmental and energy consumption problems associated with traditional breweries and carbonated beverage manufacturers. Using a combination of advanced technologies, BBG can build beverage manufacturing facilities that are CO2 neutral, energy self-sufficient, and capable of high-volume production at a much lower cost than traditional manufacturers. \n\nBBG is able to achieve CO2 neutrality by using advanced CO2 recovery techniques. When producing beer, breweries conduct a process of malting, milling, mashing, and fermenting grain. During this process, a significant amount of CO2 is created and released. BBG recovers the CO2 that would otherwise be lost and stores it for its own use and for resale.\n\nBBG is not just energy self-sufficient, it can generate enough energy to sell surplus electricity back to the power grid. During the brewing process, residual materials such as spent grains and yeast can be fermented to form biogas. In BBG’s facilities, biogas is converted into thermal and electrical energy in a combined heat and power unit (CHP). \n\nIn addition, after being used to produce biogas, the remnants of the brewing process can be recycled to sell as protein supplements and fertilizer.\n\nBBG uses much less water than traditional beverage manufacturers. In a typical brewery or beverage plant, anywhere from one to three gallons of water is used for every gallon of beer or beverage produced. The water reclamation and purification system we use reduces water use by 80%. Further purification and treatment of water can be used to help replicate the flavor profile of almost any beer. This allows BBG to formulate and supply beer to other brands.",

Far, far away from her home in the beautiful tea estates in India, a moment of mindfulness seemed elusive in the “city that never sleeps”. She dreamed of introducing America to the simplicity of slowing down and creating space to pause, only to be recharged with purpose, through a moment of mindfulness- found quite simply through a sip of Chai Diaries tea.\nExpertly blended with key ingredients aiming to engage the mind, body and soul in a restorative ritual, Chai Diaries was born out of this nostalgia.\nManufacturing and blending teas for all times of the day-from breakfast to nighttime chill and all personalities – the caffeine-addict to the mom trying to catch a break – Chai Diaries teas are made in India and enjoyed  worldwide.",

Leaving the city life behind, we jumped into this adventure by buying 30 hectares of land with forests, waterfalls and grazelands, surrounded by the mountain stretches of the National Park of Três Picos, close to Nova Friburgo in Rio de Janeiro state. \n\nOur project has converted a conventional farm in a sustainable permaculture haven. Projects implemented include setting up all soft and hard infrastructure, building of an ecological sewage system, establishing an agroforest with focus on coffee, fruit, wood and nut production, partly with CO2 compensation. Additionally, we've undertaken bio-construction, created a natural pool, manage a volunteer community, and initiated an eco-pedagogic project with local schools to raise awareness about sustainable practices.\n\nMAARA is more than a cultivation initiative; it aspires to be a reference and permaculture playground for like-minded individuals. The goal is to foster collaborative learning, share experiences, produce sustainable food, and enhance land fertility, productivity, and biodiversity. Rooted in principles of harmony and respect for nature and the local community, MAARA seeks to catalyse positive change, aspiring to be a beacon of inspiration for those passionate about creating a sustainable future.\n\nWe welcome volunteers from around the world, providing an opportunity to learn about permaculture, agroforest management, organic gardening, soil regeneration, composting, the importance of bees and other insects, as well as enjoying nutritious vegetarian meals and community living. Nestled in a comfortable farmhouse amid breath-taking mountainous scenery near Rio de Janeiro, it's the perfect setting to embark on a journey of discovery.

    "description": "Our original Main Street Café was founded in 1991, and began operations as a small deli in the old Capitol Theatre building on Main Street in Willimantic, CT. Occupying both the lobby and concession area of the theatre, seating was limited to 50 people. After 3 years we were bursting at the seams and made the move to 877 Main Street, another historic building. There we expanded to a full service restaurant and featured American craft-brewed beers and an extensive menu.\r\n\r\nOne more move was in the cards for us, and we made yet another trek down Main Street to our home in the current granite and limestone 1909 U.S. Post Office Building. Abandoned in 1967 by the Federal Government this building lay vacant for nearly 30 years. When used as a post office, our dining room was the post office work room, our pub was the customer lobby, and the private dining room was the Postmaster‘s office. Although extensive renovations have been made to the building, we wanted to retain the early 20th century architecture as well as create a pleasant atmosphere for dining. Remnants of post office memorabilia have been preserved to add to the flavor of the restaurant. Featured in our dining room is a 12‘ by 17‘ mural, created by Gordan MacDonald, depicting 1920‘s Main Street scene. A 60‘ mahogany bar, crafted by Peter Huckins is the centerpiece of the pub area. \r\n\r\nIt is in this building that the Willimantic Brewing Company was born. Viewed from our Dining Room, our 7 barrel brewery produces our freshly made handcrafted beers. Please feel free to explore our main floor and discover all our hidden treasures. On behalf of our entire staff, we welcome you and hope you share in our excitement for our living landmark restaurant and pub brewery.",

We take care of the complete supply-chain, door to door. \n\nTechnology plays a central role in our day-to-day lives – and so should it when choosing our coffees. Currently developing a marketplace, we seek to reduce information asymmetries between growers and roasters, bringing them closer together. Growers need to understand the value of their product and be at liberty to directly market their beans to coffee lovers around the globe.\n\nOur presence in Brazil, Europe and the US gives us the chance to connect the largest coffee origin to the largest coffee consumers. The concentration on solely Brazil as a source allows us to increase the efficiency of our value-chain from farm to cup. \n\nSão Paulo | Berlin | New York",

He wanted to pursue the American Dream like all other American Dreamers from The Mayﬂower to this day. He located the elite material manufacturers from Germany, Sweden, Japan, and the USA, but could not ﬁnd the right one even after auditing 80+ knifemakers.

After that, in 1954 Roca started the production of brassware.\n\nIn the 90s the Group developed a first step of international expansion, mainly based on setting up commercial branches and signing agreements with local leading brands. Besides Portugal and France, Roca’s presence started to spread over the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Russia, Morocco, Argentina, Brazil and China.\n\nThe turning point of the internationalization process took place in 1999, with the acquisition of the Swiss Keramik Holding Laufen, fourth global manufacturer in those days. The acquisition of Laufen allowed the Group to strengthen its position in strategic markets where the brand had less presence, such as Eastern Europe, Brazil and the USA.\n\nIn 2005 Roca announces an ambitious strategic plan focused on bathroom spaces, achieving the world leadership of the sector in 2006.\n\nToday, Roca is a global brand with presence in more than 170 markets, supplied by its 78 production plants and over 22.600 employees worldwide.\n\nRoca Tile USA is an offspring of the Roca Corporation. It is a worldwide leader in manufacturing, distributing and marketing of high-quality ceramic and porcelain tile under two brands Roca and United States Ceramic Tile. The company’s product range offers solutions for multiple uses, from versatile wall tile to highly resistant indoor and outdoor floor tiles, including single colors, marble, wood, concrete, fabric, decorative tiles and a wide array of complementary pieces.",

Our motto, “Coffee Roasted for Friends®,” is more than a slogan, it’s really our mission, our reason for being in this business. Coffee is a social stimulus that brings people together to share ideas and stories, and when people come together, a community is formed and friends are made. \n\nWe’re a small-town roaster located in Middlebury, Vermont. The big flavor and complex character of our coffees are highlights of our unique style of slow-roasting our beans in small batches—a process that founder Paul Ralston has perfected since the company began roasting commercially in 2000. As of April 2018 we're roasting all of our coffee using 100% renewable energy.\n\nABOUT OUR COFFEE\nAll of our beans are 100% certified organic. We source them from the great coffee-growing regions around the world, seeking out big flavor and bold character in the beans we choose.\n\nWe've developed a unique style of slow-roasting our coffee in small batches, which caramelizes the beans and brings out the semi-sweet, chocolate flavor.\n\nWHERE TO FIND OUR COFFEE\nOur coffee is sold in chain grocery stores, local markets and food co-ops throughout the Northeast including Hannaford's, Market Basket, Shaw's and Costco. Products are sold nationally via the company's online store. Our visit us in person at the Vermont Coffee Company CAFE. ",
