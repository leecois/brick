    "description": "Château Montana was founded at the end of the 19th century. With the backing of his family, Jean Jonquères d’Oriola, the son of winegrowers based in the Pyrénées Orientales for over 5 centuries set about developing the fineness and powerfulness of this terroir and the potential of the location driven by his passion. The vineyard covers sixty hectares over two terroirs in the Aspres on the foothills of the Pic du Canigou, between the sea and the mountains, south of Perpignan. We work on the clay-limestone soils with traditional grape stocks such as Syrah, Grenache, Carignan and Mourvèdre as well as other varietals such as Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Marselan and Muscat. We now have \"High Environmental Value\" certification, which gives pride of place to traditional methods, such as working the soil mechanically and respecting the environment, which promote biodiversity and keep yields low. Now we are in our second year of conversion over to organic growing. Our production will be certified organic for the 2023 vintage. Our wines are matured, mellowed and bottled at the property in our cellar equipped with heat-regulated stainless steel vats and a cask storage cellar. In addition to its wine-growing activity that it will reveal to you when you come to visit and sample our wines, Château Montana rents out its function room and self-catering accommodation for all kinds of events.",

Only high-quality organic ingredients are used to make these drinks. The company is also committed to the environment, minimising waste and preferring to use French raw materials where possible. Product quality is your guarantee of an artisanal product using seasonal ingredients. Fresh fruits are selected with great care and used only when fully mature to ensure they deliver their full aroma. The recipes are 100% natural, with no adding flavouring or colourant. Fruits are thinly sliced to maximise the flavour they release and ensure a uniform product. Bottling is also carried out entirely by hand, bottle by bottle. Our organic AOC Armagnac comes from the Landes region of France, from an estate that has operated in Bas-Armagnac since 1860, the first to be certified organic for Armagnac, whose production faithfully expresses the region's natural heritage. Our organic rum is distilled in collaboration with the BOWS distillery near Carcassonne in south-western France. BOWS is renowned for its premium spirits and shares the same values as Les Arrangeurs Français in terms of respect for provenance and products. Check out our catalogue and contact us!",

CHÂTEAU LE BREZEGUET also produces a vintage from its old vines that are 35–40 years old. It is a 100% Malbec vintage. Vinification lasts 3–4 weeks with a final warm vinification and the wine is matured exclusively in oak casks for at least 18 months. Lastly, CHÂTEAU LE BREZEGUET also produces a wine from its youngest vines, CHEMIN DE COMPOSTELLE. The grape stocks used are Malbec and Merlot. They are highly aromatic thirst-quenchers that come in red and rosé wines.

    "description": "Jack is Alexander, a globetrotter who hovers between impulsive and calculating. Always loved really good coffee and his many trips to southern Europe have reinforced this feeling. Drinking coffee should be a moment where you feel life! He loves to drink a strong espresso at any moment of the day.\n\nMack is a Portuguese roastery. Don't expect an industrial roast where some of the coffee beans are burned (think coffee beans with a gloss finish) and some of the coffee beans aren't roasted at all. Here, with 2 roasting kettles of 120 kg each, the coffee is patiently roasted to get the basis for an excellent coffee.\n\nJack Mack Coffee is specially designed for your daily cup of coffee of any kind at work or at home. Our coffee beans are roasted in Portugal because we want to break new ground without compromise. Always committed to enjoying coffee.\n\nWe want to bring the coffee of the 21st century to the market and we understand the rules of the coffee business. And strive to reinvent them again and again. Our whole beans are freshly roasted in small batches so you can enjoy freshness every time.\n\nOne thing connects Jack to Mack; the love of a good coffee that can be a little stronger at an honest price. We take advantage of the transparent internet, the Dutch cleverness of Jack and Mack's calm roasting. We already said it: we want to expand the rules in the coffee business and bring a 'brave' coffee to the market.\n\nPlease visite our website and contact us for more information !",

Kenya coffee is distinctly bright with complex tones of fruit and berry. Kenyan coffees are wet-processed (washed) coffees—bold and with a body that is usually full or medium.Kenya Coffee has Resonant Cup Presence. Known for their potent sweetness and powerful character, Kenyan coffees have a resonant cup presence, exhibiting intense flavors with a distinct winey richness and dry, winey aftertaste similar to Ethiopian Harrar yet with more of a full-bodied richness than Ethiopian coffees. A good Kenya coffee is vibrant yet clean and crisp, not subtle or delicate, and typically very well-balanced. Notes of lemony citrus may be present, even pepper, along with tones of blackberry. The aftertaste of a Kenya coffee may be quite dry with a lemony zest to it, or perhaps winey. We supply the best quality roasted Kenyan Arabica Coffee, sourced from the fertile coffee growing areas around Mt. Kenya. Whether you want the highest quality AA Arabica or a blend of grades, we can deliver huge volumes within short delivery deadlines.",

    "description": "When it comes to quality coffee, controlling the roasting process is one of the most essentials steps in achieving the most desirable recipe. At the beginning of the roasting cycle, the green beans color starts to shift to yellow and then to increasingly darker shades of brown. This change in color shows the physical and chemical transformations that occur during roasting. The Photovolt 580-PC Roast Color Classification System assists during the roasting process by measuring the color of roasted whole or ground beans. The 580-PC is a reflectance meter that can be used at any stage during the roasting process to determine not only the reflectance value, but the relative SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) number of the batch. Roast masters find it easier to follow their roast profile and create consistent batches with the help of the 580-PC. Many roastmasters judge roast color by eye, which can lead to inconsistencies. The 580-PC is specifically designed to measure ground or whole roast coffee beans. Photovolt’s instruments are all NIST traceable, which means the measurement of color you receive is traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technologies in Washington D.C.. Different from similar products in the marketplace, such as Agtron, the Photovolt 580-PC provides the most accurate, precise reading possible.",

The story of Has Kahve starts in 1952 by roasting raw coffee beans carefully and pounding them up in a mortar. The production, which started in a small shop, becomes Konya's known and wanted coffee in a short time. For many years, he continued to pound coffee in his small but nostalgic shop. Roasted coffee, the sound of stone mortar and attractive smell gives off odour to the whole bazaar on certain days. From time to time, fresh coffee is served while pleasant conversations are held in the patiently awaited queues.",

    "description": "Five key features on MiKoffee that make it a unique gourmet brand: MiKoffee is Direct Flame Roasted - We direct flame roast our coffee using natural Italian oak wood. This process is different from wood roasting where the drum is heated from outside to roast the coffee. Direct flame roasting is better than other types of roasting, but has long been discarded because it is harder, more difficult to get right and cannot be mass produced. It is because of these reasons that we choose to keep roasting in this manner, whilst all others switched to other methods. MiKoffee has a distinct roast flavour. As the flame of the burning oak touches the beans to roast them, it also gives the coffee a distinct taste that no other roasting can give. \nMiKoffee is a traditional product: we use our 65 years old Vittoria to roast the coffee and still use the same traditional methods. MiKoffee is a limited production product, because of our production limitations and because there are no more 1952 Vittoria machines, there is a limit to how much coffee we can roast unlike other roasters. MiKoffee is a gourmet made in Tuscany brand - we have been producing quality coffee for 65 years in Montecatini, a city close to Pisa, Chianti & Florence. The knowledge of how to roast has been transmitted over the years from one Italian Master Roaster to another. I invite you to visit our new website mikoffee.it to see more about our brand and product.",

The plants are harvested when their trichromes reach a slight amber colour indicating they’ve reached the last stage of their journey. Even with OMRI certified nutrients, we flush our plants to perfection, allowing excess nutrients used up in the soil to achieve full terpene production and maximum mouthwatering taste. After the plants are harvested from our hemp farm, the flowers are dried and cured using craftsmanship honed over years of practice. Then they are stored in a climate-controlled area. All of this happens on site, so we can control and commune with the whole process and offer something we believe in. Anyone can grow with chemicals and get fast results, but these come at a cost to the environment and consumer.

By working closely with our coffee bean suppliers we ensure that the green Arabica coffee beans we source are not only the highest quality but also both sourced ethically and sustainably. These beans are then roasted by us in Exeter and delivered to you within days of being roasted to ensure that you get the very best coffee possible! We are a family run coffee company, which means the whole process is completed by our own fair hands, from roasting, to packing and sealing the bags ready for delivery. This means we are able to make sure each bag of coffee is produced to the same high standard. Coffee Subscription Our coffee subscription process is designed to give you the coffee that is most suited to how you like to drink it. Whether you like it roasted light or dark, ground or whole beans we are happy to oblige. We are not going to tell you that your coffee should only be enjoyed in a particular way. This is coffee for everyone, to be enjoyed at home, the office or wherever else you may fancy! We are not afraid to try unusual coffees from non-traditional areas of the world on occasions so when you join our coffee subscription service keep an open mind!",

Our company is very proud of our team. Our experienced oenologists develop a custom technological map for each wine brand. Furthermore, we check the quality of the wine at every fermentation stage via laboratory tests, which enable a professional assessment of the wine quality. The grapes are harvested by hand in small 12 kg crates. As early as this stage, unripe/rotten grapes can be removed, then the collected grapes are immediately sent to the cantina, so that they have no time to wither or spoil. This increases the quality of our wine. Our two cantinas are fitted with the latest equipment from the leading companies of the Defranceschi wine industry. The wine cellar BARRIQUES are equipped with new SAYRI barrels made of French oak. To mature the wine, we use barrels from the Italian companies Mastro Bottaio and Garbellotto, which have become well-established on the market. We also send wine to potential partners for tasting.",

With the passage of time, the domaine grew in size and sales increased. In 2016, Domaine La Goujonne acquired the remaining family-owned parcels adjacent to the Vicari bastide, extending the domaine by a further 20 hectares. Domaine La Goujonne is now certified organic, after a 3-year conversion process audited by ECOCERT to ensure that products and practices meet the required standards. The domaine has always worked to grow grapes in a rational way that respects the environment. We prefer working the soil and cooperating with livestock farmers rather than using weed killers. We use minimal phytosanitary treatments, and only ever use the correct insecticide-free products that have been certified and recommended.

    "description": "The story of Vignobles Kandler started 30 years ago when our Franco-German family decided to acquire land in the hinterlands of the Minervois region, in Roubia, an area between sea and mountain, between the medieval town of Carcassonne and the Canal du Midi. Château Tourril takes its name from the Pierre du Tourril, an ancient Gallo-Roman signal tower that has looked over this scrubland for over 2000 years. The second generation of the family took over in 2014 and decided to expand the winery, switch to certified organic production, work to boost its profile and export sales. Driven by his love of wines from southern France, Stephan Kandler met Bertrand Hardy, himself from a wine-making family in the Rhone valley, and together they decided to make their first organic wine together, a 2016 vintage at Bertrand's Domaine des Pentelines, close to Avignon. After three vintages made jointly, Bertrand sold Stephan the marvellous 24 hectares of organic DPO Côtes du Rhône Villages Gadagne, a pebble-based terroir identical to that found in Châteauneuf du Pape. The characteristics of these two terroirs, these two appellations, are profoundly marked by the history and climate of southern France, and the influence of the Mediterranean in particular. The geographical similarities are heightened by our expertise in typical grape varieties that allow each terroir to express its own unique personality.",

The alchemy of the fermentation captures secrets, desires and passions which are just waiting to be shared. In our duty towards nature, organic farming together with the dynamic energy of the volcanic soil have been the key to this unique tasting, non-homologated wine and it is something in which we firmly believe in. Vigna Vantanara is the estate where we best express our winery’s cru to certified organic farming. The Aglianico appears to the palate as full-bodied and velvety as it benefits from the minerality of the land and reaffirms itself in the passage to wood. The round, well-balanced structure is guaranteed thanks to the extraordinary temperature fluctuations. The instantly enjoyable Falanghina is distinguished by a fresh and fruity aroma accompanied by a distinct sapidity which is obtained through the dissolution of effusive minerals during rainfalls. It’s vivid and sincere aromas are unique and unmistakeable.",

Château Ferreyres embarked on its transition to organic growing in September 2019, and reveals all its delectable notes of its grape varieties through an elegant range. The wines are the expression of a rare flint terroir, and the painstaking work in the Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur appellation cellars. The vivid, expressive wines of the Château Ferreyres vintages will arouse the curiosity of those with intrigued palates as well as well-seasoned wine drinkers. The Château Ferreyres vineyard is to be found in a rare terroir, exposed on superb sun-drenched hills. The high flint content in the argilloarenaceous soil gives the Château Ferreyres wines powerful red berry notes and unique balance. As a result, these wines can be savoured from their very first years, but they can also be laid down for drinking later. The red wines are produced on 25 hectares, mainly planted with Merlot, but also Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon varietals. The Sauvignon Blanc plots and soon the Semillon plots are earmarked for producing our white wine. Feel free to contact us for more information!",

The active substance is tadalafil, the same substance is also found in other products of this kind. The most important characteristics of this molecule are a long-lasting effect, which can last up to 36 hours, as well as the fact that the concentration of the drug in plasma and its effect is not affected by the intake of food and alcohol. Erectile dysfunction is a problem with which, according to world statistics, every tenth male is encountered. It is not associated with ageing; it can also occur in young people and older men, but the cause of the origin is different. For younger people, erectile dysfunction is most often of a psychic nature, while in the older it is the result of a disease (organic nature). In addition to the already known drugs containing tadalafil as the main substance, one drug stands out, which is tadalista medicine for erectile dysfunction.",

To this day, CROIX MARON Cognacs are the expression of an ancestral savoir-faire and the fineness of their land of origin: Grande Champagne, 1st cru of Cognac.\n\n“ Legend has it that double distillation was invented by the Chevalier de la Croix Maron, Lord of Segonzac, a pious man who dreamt that Satan was trying to damn his soul. In his dream, he saw himself in the Devil’s cauldron, but his faith was so deeply anchored in his soul that it resisted the first “cooking”. To achieve his ends, the Devil was forced to “cook” it again. When he woke up, the Chevalier had the idea of extracting the “soul” of eau-de-vie with a second distillation.”\n\nThis is how the legend on the origin of the discovery of double distillation for Cognac eaux-de-vie was perpetuated in the region.\n\nDistilled in the heart of the region where Cognac draws its roots, according to the same centuries-old methods, CROIX MARON Cognacs are, still today, the legacy of this tradition.",
